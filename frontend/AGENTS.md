# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and others) when working with the DeerFlow frontend. It is the source of truth; the sibling `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

DeerFlow Frontend is a Next.js 16 web interface for an AI agent system. It communicates with a LangGraph-based backend to provide thread-based AI conversations with streaming responses, artifacts, and a skills/tools system.

**Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS 4, pnpm 10.26.2. Requires Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10.26.2+.

### Core dependencies

- **LangGraph SDK** (`@langchain/langgraph-sdk` ^1.5.3) — Agent orchestration and streaming
- **LangChain Core** (`@langchain/core` ^1.1.15) — Fundamental AI building blocks
- **TanStack Query** (`@tanstack/react-query` ^5.90.17) — Server state management
- **UI**: Shadcn UI, MagicUI, React Bits, and Vercel AI SDK elements (generated from registries — see Code Style)

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides vulnerable `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.9.x releases to
0.9.12 for GHSA-965w-775f-mr7g. Nextra pulls it in through MathJax and
`speech-rule-engine@4.1.2`, which pins 0.9.8. Keep the override until the
upstream dependency chain resolves a patched version without it; regenerate
`pnpm-lock.yaml` and verify the docs build when changing this constraint.

## Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Start the development server with Webpack     |
| `pnpm build`     | Production build                              |
| `pnpm check`     | Lint + type check (run before committing)     |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint only                                   |
| `pnpm lint:fix`  | ESLint with auto-fix                          |
| `pnpm format`    | Prettier check (`pnpm format:write` to apply) |
| `pnpm test`      | Run unit tests with Rstest                    |
| `pnpm test:e2e`  | Run E2E tests with Playwright (Chromium)      |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript type check (`tsc --noEmit`)        |
| `pnpm start`     | Start production server                       |

Unit tests live under `tests/unit/` and mirror the `src/` layout (e.g., `tests/unit/core/api/stream-mode.test.ts` tests `src/core/api/stream-mode.ts`). Powered by Rstest; import source modules via the `@/` path alias.

Webpack is the default development bundler. Use `DEER_FLOW_DEV_BUNDLER=turbo` with `pnpm dev` to opt in to Turbopack when diagnosing a local Next.js bundler issue.

Rstest runs them as two projects (`rstest.config.ts`). `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` run in a plain **node** environment — that is nearly the whole suite, and it is the default for anything that is pure logic. `*.dom.test.ts` / `*.dom.test.tsx` run in **happy-dom**, for tests that need a document: hooks driven through `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react`, and components. Keep the split — a DOM environment costs roughly 3x the runtime of the node suite, so tests that do not render should not opt into it. A hook whose behavior only exists under real React (effect ordering, cleanup on unmount, re-render on store change) belongs in a `.dom.test.*` file rather than a node test that mocks `react` itself.

E2E tests live under `tests/e2e/` and use Playwright with Chromium. They mock all backend APIs via `page.route()` network interception and test real page interactions (navigation, chat input, streaming responses). Config: `playwright.config.ts`. The real-backend auth contract in `tests/e2e-real-backend/auth-disabled-contract.spec.ts` and `backend/tests/test_auth_me_permissions.py` pin the complete route-permission list; update both when adding registered permissions (including `projects:read/write/delete`).

The dedicated `run-history.ts` hook replaces the unpaged runs hook. Show counts
only after a successful history read, never during initial loading or errors.
Scheduled run history uses task/page query keys and the existing live offset API.
Fetch 51 rows to display 50 plus a next-page sentinel; never append pages. Only
page zero polls or refreshes on focus/reconnect. Task switches reset to page zero,
and consumed AbortSignals cancel obsolete reads. Live offsets are not snapshots;
explicit mutations or navigation may observe newly inserted runs.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js) ──▶ LangGraph SDK ──▶ LangGraph Backend (lead_agent)
                                              ├── Sub-Agents
                                              └── Tools & Skills
```

The frontend is a stateful chat application. Users create **threads** (conversations), send messages, set thread-scoped `/goal` completion conditions, and receive streamed AI responses. The backend orchestrates agents that can produce **artifacts** (files/code), **todos**, and goal state updates.

### Source Layout (`src/`)

- **`app/`** — Next.js App Router. Routes include `/` (landing), `/showcase/[thread_id]` (allowlisted public read-only demos), `/workspace/chats/[thread_id]` (authenticated chat), `/workspace/agents/[agent_name]` and `/workspace/agents/new` (custom agents), `/artifacts/view` (chrome-free window that renders Markdown or CSV/TSV artifacts with the panel's own renderer), `/blog/…`, the `(auth)/{login,setup,auth/callback}` flow, `/[lang]/docs/…`, and `/api/…` route handlers (e.g. `/api/memory`).
- **`components/`** — React components:
  - `ui/` — Shadcn UI primitives (auto-generated, ESLint-ignored)
  - `ai-elements/` — Vercel AI SDK elements (auto-generated, ESLint-ignored)
  - `workspace/` — Chat page components (messages, artifacts, settings)
  - `landing/` — Landing page sections
  - `docs/` — Docs / MDX rendering components
- **`core/`** — Business logic, the heart of the app. Domains include `threads/` (creation, streaming, state), `api/` (LangGraph client singleton), `agents/` (custom agents), `subagents/` (runtime worker catalog and administrator mutations), `auth/` (authentication), `artifacts/`, `channels/` (IM connections), `integrations/` (managed third-party integration status/install clients such as Lark CLI), `i18n/` (en-US, zh-CN), `settings/`, `memory/`, `skills/`, `messages/`, `mcp/`, `models/`, `input-polish/` (pre-send draft rewrite API), `voice-input/` (browser speech-recognition helpers), `suggestions/`, `tasks/`, `todos/`, `tools/`, `workspace-changes/` (run-scoped changed-file summaries and diff fetching), `config/`, `notification/`, `blog/`, plus rendering helpers (`rehype/`, `streamdown/`) and `utils/`.
- **`hooks/`** — Shared React hooks
- **`lib/`** — Utilities (`cn()` from clsx + tailwind-merge)
- **`content/`** — MDX content (blog posts, docs) rendered by the app
- **`styles/`** — Global CSS with Tailwind v4 `@import` syntax and CSS variables for theming
- **`typings/`** — Ambient TypeScript declarations
- Root files: `env.js` (env validation), `mdx-components.ts` (MDX component map)

More specific `AGENTS.md` files under `src/` contain the frontend sections split from this file.

## Code Style

`core/utils/markdown.ts` reads web-fetch titles from the first nonblank line.
Match zero to three literal spaces before `# ` without trimming indentation;
mixed space/tab code blocks must fall back to the URL. Keep this local to title
extraction rather than changing the shared streamdown fence parser.

Custom Agent `display_name` is an optional Unicode UI label, edited in
`AgentSettingsDialog`. Use it with a fallback to `name` for gallery/chat text;
keep `name` for React identity, URLs, requests, and runtime `agent_name`.
The 100-code-point budget uses `[...value.trim()].length`, matching Pydantic;
do not use HTML `maxLength`, which counts UTF-16 code units instead.

- **Imports**: Enforced ordering (builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling), alphabetized, newlines between groups. Use inline type imports: `import { type Foo }`.
- **Unused variables**: Prefix with `_`.
- **Class names**: Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional Tailwind classes.
- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `src/*`.
- **Components**: `ui/` and `ai-elements/` are generated from registries (Shadcn, MagicUI, React Bits, Vercel AI SDK) — don't manually edit these.

Scheduled-task list search filters the current authorized query result by title or
prompt, composing with status/type filters and thread scope. Selection must derive
from the filtered list so hidden tasks cannot remain actionable. Keep literal
matching in `core/scheduled-tasks/search.ts`; clearing search retains other filters.

Single-run schedule edits retain the mounted task's original `run_at` while its wall time and timezone match. The parent echoes edits through `initial`; retain a stable snapshot and reset the parent draft during render before remounting with a task key when switching tasks. Use the resolved timezone consistently for the snapshot and displayed wall time. Component and scheduled-task E2E tests cover DST folds and timestamp precision.

## Environment

Scheduled-task interval forms preserve the initial `every_seconds` on mount,
timezone changes, and untouched blur. The backend's configurable interval minimum
can be lower than the UI's default 60-second floor. Apply that UI floor only after
an explicit amount/unit edit so editing metadata or duplicating a task cannot
silently change its cadence. Component regressions live in
`tests/unit/components/workspace/scheduled-task-schedule-input.dom.test.tsx`.

Backend API URLs are optional; an nginx proxy is used by default:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api
```

Leave these unset for the standard `make dev` / Docker flow, where nginx serves the public `/api/langgraph/*` prefix and rewrites it to Gateway's native `/api/*` routes.

`make build-static` creates a standalone read-only demo and copies `.next/static`
and `public` into the output. In static mode, `core/api/static-response.ts`
resolves Gateway REST reads with the bundled capability catalog and safe
installation projections from existing same-origin `/mock/api` fixtures; writes
and unknown API routes fail locally.
The homepage client counter calls `/github-stars`, outside the Gateway proxy.
That dynamic route reads the server-only `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` at runtime, caches
GitHub data for one hour, and returns 204 when the count is unavailable. Start
the standalone server from `frontend/` with `node --env-file=.env
.next/standalone/server.js` to load the current credentials.

To reach a dev server on anything other than localhost — a LAN address, or a proxied hostname — list the host in `DEER_FLOW_DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated; a full URL is reduced to its host). It feeds Next's `allowedDevOrigins`, which gates `/_next/*`, fonts, and HMR. Without it those requests get a 403 and the page renders server-side but never hydrates, so nothing on it — including the login form — responds. Development only; production builds ignore it.

One-time schedule input uses `validZonedLocalToUtcIso` to reject wall times that
do not round-trip in the selected timezone. Invalid input emits an empty spec and
localized inline feedback; both create and edit must block submission. Keep this
UI validation separate from the API payload. Preserve the original instant when
wall time and timezone match the mounted snapshot; validate changed inputs, and
restore the exact original timestamp when those edits are reverted.

## Contributing

When adding features:

1. Follow the established `src/` structure
2. Add TypeScript types and proper error handling
3. Write unit tests under `tests/unit/` (`pnpm test`) and E2E tests under `tests/e2e/` (`pnpm test:e2e`)
4. Run `pnpm check` before committing
5. Update this `AGENTS.md` when architecture, commands, or conventions change

Route asset budgets are enforced with `pnpm perf:check`. The command measures
`/login` from a normal production build, then builds in static-demo mode for the
fixture-backed workspace routes. It starts the production server on temporary local
ports, measures the unique JavaScript and CSS files referenced by representative
routes, writes the detailed result to `.next/performance-results.json`, and compares
totals with `performance-budgets.json`. Fix route ownership or split points when a
budget fails; do not raise a ceiling without documenting and reviewing the measured
regression.

Chat archive is a thread metadata flag (`deerflow_archived === true`), independent
of run status. Sidebar and Chats explicitly request the Gateway's optional
`archived` filter through `searchThreadsByArchive`; the SDK drops this extension,
so use the authenticated REST fetcher. Static demos retain SDK fixture queries.
`core/threads/archive.ts` waits for the write, cancels stale reads, merges only the
owned flag into metadata snapshots, then restarts metadata reads and resets list
pagination. Keep both default and Custom Agent header restore controls in sync.
Pin/archive responses must not merge unrelated metadata flags: out-of-order
organization requests can otherwise roll back each other's confirmed state.
Run-created optimistic snapshots have no archive flag: refresh archive-filtered
lists from the server instead of inserting those snapshots into either view.

### Delimited artifact preview

CSV/TSV previews share `artifact-table-preview.tsx` between the panel and standalone viewer. Papa Parse runs only inside `delimited-preview.worker.ts`; `use-delimited-preview.ts` bounds input before transfer, cancels stale work, and enforces a five-second timeout. The parser detects the first record separator outside quoted fields and passes it explicitly to Papa Parse, so embedded newlines in an incomplete quoted field cannot corrupt newline detection. It retains at most 202 logical records and 50 columns, discarding an incomplete final record from truncated input. UI pagination displays at most 200 data rows in pages of 50. Keep the table mounted but inactive when switching to source so header/pagination state survives; changing file identity resets it. Pending `write_file` content stays in source mode until success.

Custom skill export is admin-only and disabled in static demos. The lazy
`skill-export-dialog.tsx` must abort requests and ignore stale callbacks on close
or user/skill changes. `core/skills/export.ts` owns the revision-bound Blob download;
HTTP 409 requires explicit preview refresh. Keep file lists paginated and diagnostics
localized. Browser handoff does not prove the file was saved to disk.

Sidebar rows request deletion through `ThreadDeleteDialogProvider`, hosted in
`WorkspaceSidebar` outside the virtualized flat/project lists. Keep the selected
thread snapshot and retry UI alive when a partial deletion removes its row.
Focus Cancel on open and after a failed deletion has re-enabled the actions;
block dismissal while deletion is pending. Show the error message when available,
with a localized fallback, and log the rejection for debugging. The shared
delete helper accepts remote 404 (not 403) before retrying local cleanup, and
`onDeleted` runs only after both deletion steps succeed.

## Capability Center

`/workspace/capabilities` owns Plugins and Skills navigation. Plugins composes the
MCP manager and a lazily loaded Lark configuration dialog; installation, OAuth,
mutation permissions, and cache ownership remain in the existing hooks. Skill display names/summaries are presentation
metadata; runtime names and full descriptions remain unchanged. Public, custom,
integration, and legacy sources must stay distinct. Community currently offers
archive import, not a remote marketplace. Screenshot E2E fixtures are demo data.
`backend/packages/harness/deerflow/capabilities/builtin.json` owns localized
catalog manifests. Refresh the generated demo snapshot with `pnpm catalog:sync`
after changing the catalog; unit tests enforce equality with the source. Demo
business projections derive provider IDs from the catalog adapter metadata. The
sync script uses decoded filesystem paths for formatter configuration lookup.
`plugin-catalog.ts` only resolves localized text and explicit
installation metadata; never infer provider identity from server display names.
`plugin-directory.tsx` groups rows and applies search/category/installed filters.
`core/capabilities` consumes catalog and safe status projections; MCP secrets and
raw settings remain in the administrator-only editor. `plugin-adapters.tsx`
registers integration-specific settings flows once, independent of catalog size.
The `business` form uses manifest credential fields without asking for an MCP URL;
its backend adapter generates bundled DingTalk/WeCom notification or HubSpot CRM
connections. These also appear in MCP discovery, so deduplicate projections by
installation ID. Keep their labels as configuration, not package installation.
Keep installation, enabled state, configured credentials, and verified authorization
distinct. Agent `mcp_plugins` uses stable installation IDs; null means all, [] means
none. The settings dialog submits only selections changed from its opening
snapshot, preserving concurrent updates on unrelated saves and treating restored
selections as unchanged. It is runtime selection, not a replacement authorization policy. See
`docs/capability-center.md` for the complete contract and extension example.
`PluginIcon` is shared by recommendations, configured entries, and the editor;
brand assets and their provenance live in `public/images/plugins/`. Brand icons
require explicit catalog metadata; a custom server name never selects a brand.
Ambiguous installation IDs remain visible but cannot be selected for an Agent. The icon picker
accepts local PNG/JPEG/WebP up to 2 MiB, checks the signature, decodes and contains
the image in a 128px PNG, and stages changes until the existing targeted MCP save.
`presentation.icon` is a bounded PNG data URL carried by the API's existing extra
metadata support; it must never enter transport parameters. Preserve sibling
presentation fields and masked credentials; cancel/reset/unmount must fence stale
image-decoding results. Uploaded remote URLs and SVG are never rendered. Existing
shared-MCP administrator checks remain authoritative; this adds no personal scope.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

### Shared model settings

Settings → Models (`?settings=models`) offers administrator-only catalog management
through `/api/managed-models`. YAML entries are read-only. `core/models/management.ts`
whitelists editable fields so source metadata and `has_api_key` never get posted.
Draft credentials stay in editor state, never query cache or browser storage; blank
keeps the saved key, explicit removal sends an empty key. Saving invalidates both the
admin catalog and `MODELS_QUERY_KEY`. Editor unmount aborts probes and fences late
callbacks. Static demos and non-admin users must not query the management API.

## Full-stack plugin UI

`core/extensions/` loads authenticated deployment-installed ES modules from `/api/plugins`.
Inline modules use authenticated fetch plus a released Blob URL. Manifest assets use
native credentialed module scripts, preserving relative imports and resource URLs.
Both honor the backend base and prefixes; transport and cache semantics are documented in
`docs/full-stack-plugins.md`. Host copy belongs in the typed locale dictionaries.
Conversation action factories, shapes and availability callbacks are guarded per plugin;
only validated value snapshots reach the toolbar/sidebar render paths.
`PluginNavigation` and the dynamic workspace extension route consume page declarations;
Capability Center details only show metadata and status. Conversation action slots augment
normal/custom-agent toolbars and sidebar menus without replacing native export or notification.
Plugin views use mount/dispose and abort signals; Shadow DOM is CSS isolation, not a sandbox.
Descriptors are user-keyed page snapshots, refreshed manually. Backend calls bind the plugin's
namespace, action allowlist and expected viewer identity. See `docs/full-stack-plugins.md`.

Plugin page `openConversation(threadId)` resolves authenticated thread metadata
with `pathOfThread`; do not let plugins hardcode default-agent routes. The page's
abort signal fences late navigation after unmount/account changes. Synchronous
conversation-action callbacks reject Promise returns while consuming rejections.
