"""Shadow evaluation of the memory pre-screen (Jev) from DeerMem extraction records.

This is the pre-``enforce`` evidence for ``TypeSafeMemoryPrescreen``: the gates
documented in ``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`` ("Before ``enforce``") and in
``agents/memory/AGENTS.md``. It is an operator run over **shadow records**, not a CI
test: in ``mode: shadow`` the extraction call always runs, so every pre-screen
verdict comes with free ground truth — that same batch's extraction outcome. The
script makes no network call, reads no credential and prints none; its input is a
JSONL of DeerMem ``extraction_callback`` payloads, one per line.

What one line must contain (the payload the host already emits)
----------------------------------------------------------------

* ``prescreen`` — ``mode``/``verdict``/``probability``/``skip_threshold``/``model``/
  ``cached``/``digest``/``signals``/``message_count``/``batch_chars``/
  ``duration_ms``/``fallback_reason`` (the judge record, design §5);
* ``success`` and ``token_usage`` — the extraction call's own record;
* ``mutations_accepted`` — the pre-screen's "worth remembering" signal, written
  when the apply ran. ``> 0`` on a ``skip`` verdict means the skip would have lost
  a memory.

Fields the collector must add (absent from the production payload today)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* ``trivial_only`` (bool) — the batch's turns were all trivial (``filter_trivial``).
  The mandatory no-network baseline cannot be computed without it; coverage is
  reported instead of assumed.
* ``reviewed`` (bool) and optionally ``review_outcome`` (``worth_remembering`` |
  ``none_worth_remembering``) — the manual review that §5 gate 3 counts *and*
  whose verdict that gate reads: the review must confirm none of the reviewed
  skips was worth remembering, so a reviewed skip whose outcome (or
  ``mutations_accepted`` counter) says otherwise fails the gate. It is also a
  second ground-truth witness for a skip.
* ``stratum`` (string or list) / ``labels`` (list) — the §5 gate 2 subset, one of
  ``identity`` / ``preference`` / ``correction``. A human label, because L3 keeps
  signal-bearing batches out of the network population.
* ``cost_usd`` (float, optional) — the record's billed cost, when known.

Method, and the things it deliberately refuses to do
----------------------------------------------------

* Every record is classified into exactly one population: **network verdicts** (a
  request was really sent), **cache hits** (the same ``digest`` reused), **local
  fallbacks** (L3 / L4 / L5 / L7 / L8 or a failure fallback) and **unjudged** (no
  ``prescreen`` record was emitted at all: no side was enabled, or the round was
  forbidden to judge). Only network verdicts are
  classifier samples; mixing populations would let a cache hit or a local refusal
  vote on the model's accuracy.
* ``saved_call_rate`` (a skip that kept nothing, i.e. the call was really saved)
  and ``miss_rate`` (a skip that lost a memory) share the scored-skip denominator
  and therefore sum to 1; ``saved_call_rate_over_all_verdicts`` keeps the
  network-verdict denominator for the "how many calls did this save" reading.
* A record whose outcome is unknown (skip without ``mutations_accepted``, an
  extraction that failed before the apply) is **censored**: counted, reasoned
  about and excluded from the rates. It is never dropped to claim a pass.
* The no-network heuristic baseline is run over the same scored records as the
  model, so both rates have one denominator: the baseline skips a batch when
  ``signals`` is empty and ``trivial_only`` is true. If it already captures most
  of the saving, a third-party egress path is not justified. §5 gate 4 needs it
  *and* the recorded tokens and p50/p95 verdict latency: recorded calls alone are
  not the evidence the gate asks for, so missing any of them is ``INSUFFICIENT``
  rather than a pass. A baseline that saves as many calls as the model — which the
  shipped "everything trivial" sample does — is a ``FAIL``, not an enabling run, and
  the comparison must cover the scored skips: both sides are the records the baseline
  can actually score (``trivial_only`` plus a readable signals list), so a run that
  annotates only a subset is ``INSUFFICIENT`` instead of crediting the model with
  batches the heuristic never saw.
* The miss-rate bound is the exact one-sided **Clopper-Pearson** interval,
  computed here from the regularized incomplete beta function by bisection. No
  normal approximation is used anywhere, and the gate reads the *bound*, not the
  point estimate: a sample whose observed rate is at or below the target while its
  upper bound is above it is ``INSUFFICIENT`` — the evidence does not establish the
  target yet, so the answer is to collect more skips, not to enable.
* A count field that arrives negative (``mutations_accepted``, ``message_count``,
  ``batch_chars``, a token count) is treated as absent: a count cannot be negative,
  and scoring a corrupt one as a saving would tilt every rate toward a pass.
* The exit code carries the verdict: ``0`` only when every gate is ``PASS``,
  ``1`` when any gate is ``FAIL`` or ``INSUFFICIENT`` — so an operator can gate
  enablement on ``python scripts/eval_memory_prescreen.py --records ... && <enable>``.
