# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and others) when working with code in this repository. It is the source of truth; the sibling `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

DeerFlow is a LangGraph-based AI super agent system with a full-stack architecture. The backend provides a "super agent" with sandbox execution, persistent memory, subagent delegation, and extensible tool integration - all operating in per-thread isolated environments.

**Architecture**:
- **Gateway API** (port 8001): REST API plus embedded LangGraph-compatible agent runtime
- **Frontend** (port 3000): Next.js web interface
- **Nginx** (port 2026): Unified reverse proxy entry point
- **Provisioner** (port 8002, optional in Docker dev): Started only when sandbox is configured for provisioner/Kubernetes mode

**Runtime**:
- `make dev`, Docker dev, and production all run the agent runtime in Gateway via `RunManager` + `run_agent()` + `StreamBridge` (`packages/harness/deerflow/runtime/`). Nginx exposes that runtime at `/api/langgraph/*` and rewrites it to Gateway's native `/api/*` routers.
- Scheduled-task executions must reuse that same Gateway run lifecycle. The scheduler may decide *when* work runs, but it must dispatch through the existing run path rather than introducing a parallel execution stack.

## Important Development Guidelines

### Documentation Update Policy
**CRITICAL: Always update README.md and AGENTS.md after every code change**

When making code changes, you MUST update the relevant documentation:
- Update `README.md` for user-facing changes (features, setup, usage instructions)
- Update `AGENTS.md` for development changes (architecture, commands, workflows, internal systems). `CLAUDE.md` imports it via `@AGENTS.md`, so editing `AGENTS.md` updates both.
- Keep documentation synchronized with the codebase at all times
- Ensure accuracy and timeliness of all documentation

## Commands

**Root directory** (for full application):
```bash
make check      # Check system requirements
make install    # Install all dependencies (frontend + backend)
make dev        # Start all services (Gateway + Frontend + Nginx), with config.yaml preflight
make start      # Start production services locally
make stop       # Stop all services
```

**Backend directory** (for backend development only):
```bash
make install            # Install backend dependencies
make dev                # Run Gateway API with reload (port 8001)
make gateway            # Run Gateway API only (port 8001)
make test               # Run all backend tests
make test-blocking-io   # Run strict Blockbuster runtime gate on tests/blocking_io/
make lint               # Lint with ruff
make format             # Format code with ruff
make migrate-rev MSG="..."  # Autogenerate a new alembic revision (see Schema Migrations section)
```

The `detect-blocking-io` target parses `app/`, `packages/harness/deerflow/`,
and `scripts/` with AST. By default it reports only blocking IO candidates that
are inside async code, reachable from async code in the same file, or reachable
from sync-only `AgentMiddleware` before/after hooks that LangGraph can execute
on the async graph path. It prints a concise summary and writes complete JSON
findings to `.deer-flow/blocking-io-findings.json` at the repository root
(both `make detect-blocking-io` from the repo root and `cd backend && make
detect-blocking-io` resolve to the same repo-root path). JSON findings include
`priority`, `location`, `blocking_call`, `event_loop_exposure`, `reason`, and
`code` for model-assisted or manual review. `priority` is a deterministic
review ordering from operation type, not proof of a bug. Bare-name same-file
calls are resolved by function name, so duplicate helper names in one file can
conservatively over-report async reachability. It is intentionally
informational and is not run from CI in this round.

For a diff-scoped view of the same findings, `scripts/scan_changed_blocking_io.py`
(repo root) reports findings on the added lines of `git diff <base>...HEAD`
plus findings new versus the merge base (so a new async caller exposing an
untouched sync helper in the same file is still reported) — used by the
`blocking-io-guard` skill (`.agent/skills/blocking-io-guard/`) as the
deterministic scope step before routing each candidate to a fix and/or a
`tests/blocking_io/` runtime anchor.

Regression tests related to Docker/provisioner behavior:
- `tests/test_docker_sandbox_mode_detection.py` (mode detection from `config.yaml`)
- `tests/test_provisioner_kubeconfig.py` (kubeconfig file/directory handling)
- `tests/test_provisioner_request_threading.py` (keeps provisioner sandbox CRUD
  endpoints as sync FastAPI handlers so synchronous K8s client calls run in the
  Starlette worker pool instead of on the ASGI event loop)

Blocking-IO runtime gate (`tests/blocking_io/`):
- Wraps every item under `tests/blocking_io/` with a strict Blockbuster
  context scoped to `app.*` and `deerflow.*` (see
  `tests/support/detectors/blocking_io_runtime.py`). Any sync blocking IO
  call whose stack passes through DeerFlow business code while running on
  the asyncio event loop raises `BlockingError` and fails the test.
- Regression anchors live there: `test_skills_load.py` (locks the
  `asyncio.to_thread` offload around `LocalSkillStorage.load_skills`, fix
  for #1917); `test_sqlite_lifespan.py` (locks the offload around
  SQLite path resolution plus `ensure_sqlite_parent_dir`, fix for #1912);
  `test_jsonl_run_event_store.py` (locks `JsonlRunEventStore`'s async
  API offloading its file IO via `asyncio.to_thread`);
  `test_uploads_middleware.py` (locks `UploadsMiddleware.abefore_agent`
  offloading the uploads-directory scan off the event loop); and
  `test_uploads_router.py` (locks Gateway upload/list/delete endpoints
  offloading upload directory creation, staged writes, chmod/cleanup,
  directory scans/deletes, and remote sandbox sync off the event loop).
- `test_gate_smoke.py` is a meta-test asserting the gate actually catches
  unoffloaded blocking IO and that the `@pytest.mark.allow_blocking_io`
  opt-out works.
- Coverage boundary: the gate only sees code that test execution actually
  touches. Static AST coverage is a separate concern (out of scope for
  this PR).
- CI: runs on every PR via `.github/workflows/backend-blocking-io-tests.yml`,
  hard-fail.

Boundary check (harness → app import firewall):
- `tests/test_harness_boundary.py` — ensures `packages/harness/deerflow/` never imports from `app.*`

CI runs these regression tests for every pull request via [.github/workflows/backend-unit-tests.yml](../.github/workflows/backend-unit-tests.yml).

## Architecture

### Harness / App Split

The backend is split into two layers with a strict dependency direction:

- **Harness** (`packages/harness/deerflow/`): Publishable agent framework package (`deerflow-harness`). Import prefix: `deerflow.*`. Contains agent orchestration, tools, sandbox, models, MCP, skills, config — everything needed to build and run agents.
- **App** (`app/`): Unpublished application code. Import prefix: `app.*`. Contains the FastAPI Gateway API and IM channel integrations (Feishu, Slack, Telegram, DingTalk).

**Dependency rule**: App imports deerflow, but deerflow never imports app. This boundary is enforced by `tests/test_harness_boundary.py` which runs in CI.

**Import conventions**:
```python
# Harness internal
from deerflow.agents import make_lead_agent
from deerflow.models import create_chat_model

# App internal
from app.gateway.app import app
from app.channels.service import start_channel_service

# App → Harness (allowed)
from deerflow.config import get_app_config

# Harness → App (FORBIDDEN — enforced by test_harness_boundary.py)
# from app.gateway.routers.uploads import ...  # ← will fail CI
```

Package import hygiene: the `deerflow.agents` and `deerflow.subagents` package
roots expose heavyweight graph/executor entrypoints lazily. Internal modules
that only need lightweight types, config, or registries should import the
concrete submodule instead of adding eager package-root imports that pull in the
tool graph or subagent executor during state/schema imports.

### Agent System

**Lead Agent** (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/agent.py`):
- Entry point: `make_lead_agent(config: RunnableConfig)` registered in `langgraph.json`
- Dynamic model selection via `create_chat_model()` with thinking/vision support
- Tools loaded via `get_available_tools()` - combines sandbox, built-in, MCP, community, and subagent tools
- System prompt generated by `apply_prompt_template()` with skills, memory, and subagent instructions

**ThreadState** (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/thread_state.py`):
- Extends `AgentState` with: `sandbox`, `thread_data`, `title`, `artifacts`, `todos`, `uploaded_files`, `viewed_images`, `goal`, `promoted`, `delegations`, `skill_context`, `summary_text`
- Uses custom reducers: `merge_artifacts` (deduplicate), `merge_viewed_images` (merge/clear), `merge_goal` (preserve the active goal across ordinary state updates unless the goal writer replaces it), `merge_promoted` (catalog-hash-scoped deferred tool promotions), `merge_delegations` (append task delegation entries, same id latest wins, terminal status never downgraded, capped to the most recent entries), and `merge_skill_context` (dedupe active-skill references by path, keep the most recently read entries; entries store a name/path/description reference, not the SKILL.md body). `summary_text` is a LastValue channel updated by summarization and projected into model requests as durable context data instead of being stored as a `messages` item.

**Runtime Configuration** (via `config.configurable`):
- `thinking_enabled` - Enable model's extended thinking
- `model_name` - Select specific LLM model
- `is_plan_mode` - Enable TodoList middleware
- `subagent_enabled` - Enable task delegation tool
- `max_concurrent_subagents` - Per-response `task` call concurrency limit (clamped by `SubagentLimitMiddleware`)
- `max_total_subagents` - Optional per-run total delegation cap override (falls back to `subagents.max_total_per_run`, clamped to 1-50)
  Gateway and `DeerFlowClient.stream()` always provide the runtime `run_id`; custom
  graph integrations must do the same. If it is absent, enforcement deliberately
  counts the thread's full delegation ledger (fail-restrictive) and emits a warning.

### Middleware Chain

Lead-agent middlewares are assembled in strict order across three functions: the shared base in `packages/harness/deerflow/agents/middlewares/tool_error_handling_middleware.py` (`_build_runtime_middlewares`, exposed via `build_lead_runtime_middlewares`), then the lead-only middlewares appended in `packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/agent.py` (`build_middlewares`). Items marked *(optional)* are appended only when their config/runtime condition holds, so the live chain length varies.

**Shared runtime base** (`build_lead_runtime_middlewares`; subagents reuse most of this via `build_subagent_runtime_middlewares`):

1. **InputSanitizationMiddleware** - First, so it is the outermost `wrap_model_call` wrapper; every inner middleware (including LLM retries) sees sanitized messages
2. **ToolOutputBudgetMiddleware** - Caps tool output size (per app config) before it re-enters the model context
3. **ToolResultSanitizationMiddleware** - Neutralizes framework/injection tags (e.g. `<system-reminder>`) and boundary markers in *remote-content* tool results (`web_fetch`/`web_search`/`image_search`/`web_capture`) so attacker-controlled fetched pages cannot forge trusted framework context. Mirrors `InputSanitizationMiddleware`'s user-input guardrail for the other untrusted-content entry point; sits inner of `ToolOutputBudgetMiddleware` (neutralizes the raw output, then the budget truncates). Local tool output (bash/read_file) is left untouched. Scope is a name-based allowlist, so MCP remote-content tools registered under other names (e.g. `fetch_url`) are not yet covered — a metadata-tagging follow-up is tracked in the middleware source
4. **ThreadDataMiddleware** - Creates per-thread directories under the user's isolation scope (`backend/.deer-flow/users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}`); resolves `user_id` via `get_effective_user_id()` (falls back to `"default"` in no-auth mode)
5. **UploadsMiddleware** - Tracks and injects newly uploaded files into conversation (lead agent only)
6. **SandboxMiddleware** - Acquires sandbox, stores `sandbox_id` in state
7. **DanglingToolCallMiddleware** - Injects placeholder ToolMessages for AIMessage tool_calls that lack responses (e.g., user interruption), preserving raw provider tool-call payloads in `additional_kwargs["tool_calls"]`; malformed empty tool-call names are normalized to a recoverable error so strict OpenAI-compatible providers do not reject the next request
8. **LLMErrorHandlingMiddleware** - Normalizes provider/model invocation failures into recoverable assistant-facing errors before later stages run
9. **GuardrailMiddleware** - *(optional, if `guardrails.enabled`)* Pre-tool-call authorization via pluggable `GuardrailProvider`; returns an error ToolMessage on deny. Providers: built-in `AllowlistProvider` (zero deps), OAP policy providers (e.g. `aport-agent-guardrails`), or custom. See [docs/GUARDRAILS.md](docs/GUARDRAILS.md)
10. **SandboxAuditMiddleware** - Audits sandboxed shell/file operations for security logging before tool execution
11. **ReadBeforeWriteMiddleware** - *(optional, if `read_before_write.enabled`, default on)* Outermost write gate (issue #3857): `read_file` stamps a content hash onto its ToolMessage; `write_file` (append/overwrite-existing) and `str_replace` are blocked unless the newest mark for that path matches the file's current hash. Sits outside ToolProgressMiddleware and ToolErrorHandlingMiddleware so a blocked write returns immediately without consuming a ToolProgress slot. Blocked results call `normalize_tool_result` directly to stamp `deerflow_tool_meta` (`recoverable_by_model=True`) before returning, keeping the result well-formed for any outer consumer. Marks live on messages, so summarization dropping the read result invalidates the gate automatically; writes never refresh marks, forcing a re-read between consecutive edits. Gate check + tool execution are serialized per (thread, path) so same-turn parallel writes cannot reuse one stale mark; on sandboxes whose `read_file` reports failures as `"Error: ..."` strings instead of raising (AIO/E2B), uninspectable targets fail open (creation proceeds, no mark stamped)
12. **ToolProgressMiddleware** - *(optional, if `tool_progress.enabled`)* State-machine-based stagnation guard (RFC #3177). Outer wrapper around ToolErrorHandlingMiddleware so its `wrap_tool_call` receives results already stamped with `deerflow_tool_meta`. Tracks per-(thread, tool) consecutive "no-new-info" calls across three error categories: (a) `recoverable_by_model=True` (no_results, not_found, permission, Jaccard-duplicate success): ACTIVE → WARNED (terminal — hint re-injected on each subsequent problem); (b) `recoverable_by_model=False, action≠stop` (rate_limited, transient): ACTIVE → WARNED → BLOCKED after `warn_escalation_count` more problems; (c) `recoverable_by_model=False, action=stop` (auth, config, internal): immediately BLOCKED on first occurrence. **Division of labor with LoopDetectionMiddleware:** ToolProgressMiddleware is a result-quality guard — fires after tool execution and blocks specific tools that stop producing new information; LoopDetectionMiddleware is a call-pattern guard — fires after the model responds and hard-stops the whole turn when the model repeatedly issues identical tool_calls. Both can inject HumanMessage hints in the same model call without conflict; neither reads the other's internal state.
13. **ToolErrorHandlingMiddleware** - Receives `AppConfig`, converts tool exceptions into error `ToolMessage`s so the run can continue instead of aborting, stamps every result with `deerflow_tool_meta` (status / error_type / recoverable_by_model / recommended_next_action / source) via `tool_result_meta.normalize_tool_result`, stamps structured metadata for task exception wrappers, and stamps skill-read metadata for downstream durable-context capture. Task tool result text is generated from the same status/result/error inputs as the structured metadata so callers do not hand-write a second protocol string.

**Lead-only middlewares** (`build_middlewares`, appended after the base):

14. **DynamicContextMiddleware** - Injects the current date (and optionally memory) as a `<system-reminder>` into the first HumanMessage, keeping the base system prompt fully static for prefix-cache reuse
15. **SkillActivationMiddleware** - Detects strict `/skill-name task` syntax on the latest real user message, resolves only enabled and runtime-allowed skills, injects the `SKILL.md` body as hidden current-turn context, and records a `middleware:skill_activation` audit event
16. **DurableContextMiddleware** - Captures `task` delegations into `ThreadState.delegations` (including in-progress dispatches and terminal result summaries) and loaded skill-file references (name/path/description, parsed in-memory - not the body) into `ThreadState.skill_context` before summarization can compact the paired tool-call/result messages, then projects durable context into each model request. Static authority rules are injected as a `SystemMessage`; untrusted field values (`summary_text`, delegation results, skill descriptions) are injected separately as a hidden `HumanMessage` data block so compressed history, delegated work, and which skills are active stay visible without being stored as `messages` or promoted to system-role instructions. `build_subagent_runtime_middlewares` also attaches this middleware immediately before subagent summarization so a compacted `summary_text` is projected ahead of a preserved assistant/tool tail instead of leaving strict providers with an assistant-first request.
17. **SummarizationMiddleware** - *(optional, if enabled)* Context reduction when approaching token limits
18. **TodoListMiddleware** - *(optional, if `is_plan_mode`)* Task tracking with the `write_todos` tool
19. **TokenUsageMiddleware** - *(optional, if `token_usage.enabled`)* Records token usage metrics; subagent usage is merged back into the dispatching AIMessage by message position
20. **TitleMiddleware** - Auto-generates the thread title after the first complete exchange and normalizes structured message content before prompting the title model. If a first-turn run is interrupted before this middleware can write a title, `runtime/runs/worker.py` keeps the run in a finalizing state, persists a local fallback title from the latest checkpoint or original run input, and then syncs it to `threads_meta.display_name`. Replacement runs admitted by `multitask_strategy="interrupt"` / `"rollback"` wait for older same-thread finalization before entering the graph; the interrupted run only skips the fallback title write once a later run has started and may have advanced the checkpoint.
21. **MemoryMiddleware** - Queues conversations for async memory update (filters to user + final AI responses)
22. **ViewImageMiddleware** - *(optional, if the model supports vision)* Injects base64 image data before the LLM call
23. **McpRoutingMiddleware** - *(optional, if `tool_search.enabled` and PR1 MCP routing metadata produce a routing index)* Auto-promotes matching deferred MCP tool schemas before the model call by writing a minimal `promoted` state update. It matches only the latest real `HumanMessage`, uses the global `tool_search.auto_promote_top_k` limit (default 3, clamped to 1..5), never executes tools, and must be installed before `DeferredToolFilterMiddleware`
24. **DeferredToolFilterMiddleware** - *(optional, if `tool_search.enabled`)* Hides deferred (MCP) tool schemas from the bound model until `tool_search` or `McpRoutingMiddleware` promotes them (reads per-thread promotions from `ThreadState.promoted`, hash-scoped)
25. **SystemMessageCoalescingMiddleware** - Merges every SystemMessage into a single leading SystemMessage per request; provider-agnostic fix for strict backends (vLLM/SGLang/Qwen/Anthropic) that reject non-leading system messages. Touches the per-request payload only (checkpoint state unchanged); on midnight crossings only the latest `dynamic_context_reminder` SystemMessage survives
26. **SubagentLimitMiddleware** - *(optional, if `subagent_enabled`)* Truncates excess `task` tool calls to enforce both the per-response concurrency limit (`max_concurrent_subagents`, clamped to 2-4) and the per-run total delegation cap (`max_total_subagents` runtime override or `subagents.max_total_per_run`, default 6, clamped to 1-50). The total cap counts current-run entries in the durable delegation ledger (entries are tagged with `run_id` when captured), so repeated planning checkpoints in one run cannot keep launching legal-sized batches indefinitely, while later user turns in the same thread get a fresh run budget. If the cap is exhausted, the middleware strips remaining `task` calls, forces `finish_reason="stop"`, and appends a visible limit note so the run can synthesize existing results instead of ending with an empty tool-call response.
27. **LoopDetectionMiddleware** - *(optional, if `loop_detection.enabled`)* Detects repeated tool-call loops; hard-stop clears both structured `tool_calls` and raw provider tool-call metadata before forcing a final text answer; stamps `loop_capped` via `consume_stop_reason` (#3875 Phase 2), symmetric to `TokenBudgetMiddleware`
28. **TokenBudgetMiddleware** - *(optional, if `token_budget.enabled`)* Enforces per-run token limits
29. **Custom middlewares** - *(optional)* Any `custom_middlewares` passed to `build_middlewares` are injected here, before the terminal-response/safety/clarification tail
30. **TerminalResponseMiddleware** - When a provider returns an empty terminal `AIMessage` after tool execution, injects a hidden recovery prompt and retries the model once; a second empty response is replaced in checkpoint state by a visible error fallback marked for the run worker, so the run finishes as an error instead of a silent success
31. **SafetyFinishReasonMiddleware** - *(optional, if `safety_finish_reason.enabled`)* Suppresses tool execution when the provider safety-terminated the response (e.g. `finish_reason=content_filter`); registered after terminal-response/custom middlewares so LangChain's reverse-order `after_model` dispatch runs it first
32. **ClarificationMiddleware** - Intercepts `ask_clarification` tool calls, writes a readable `ToolMessage.content` fallback plus structured `ToolMessage.artifact.human_input` request payload, and interrupts via `Command(goto=END)` (must be last). Because this middleware can short-circuit tool execution before LangChain emits `on_tool_end`, `RunJournal` performs a root-run final reconciliation for allowlisted clarification `ToolMessage`s whose `tool_call_id` was produced by the current run, so human-input request cards remain recoverable from `run_events` after checkpoint compaction. Human Input Card replies are submitted as `hide_from_ui` `HumanMessage`s with `additional_kwargs.human_input_response`; `RunJournal` persists only allowlisted hidden response sources (currently `ask_clarification`) as `llm.human.input`, which preserves answered-card state after compaction without exposing generic internal hidden context.

### Configuration System

**Main Configuration** (`config.yaml`):

Setup: Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` in the **project root** directory.

**Config Versioning**: `config.example.yaml` has a `config_version` field. On startup, `AppConfig.from_file()` compares user version vs example version and emits a warning if outdated. Missing `config_version` = version 0. Run `make config-upgrade` to auto-merge missing fields. When changing the config schema, bump `config_version` in `config.example.yaml`.

**Config Caching**: `get_app_config()` caches the parsed config, but automatically reloads it when the resolved config path or file content signature changes. The signature includes file metadata and a content digest, so Gateway and LangGraph reads stay aligned with `config.yaml` edits even on object-store or network mounts where mtime can remain stale.

**Config Hot-Reload Boundary**: Gateway dependencies route through `get_app_config()` on every request, so per-run fields like `models[*].max_tokens`, `summarization.*`, `title.*`, `memory.*`, `subagents.*`, `tools[*]`, and the agent system prompt pick up `config.yaml` edits on the next message. `AppConfig` is intentionally **not** cached on `app.state` — `lifespan()` keeps a local `startup_config` variable for one-shot bootstrap work and passes it to `langgraph_runtime(app, startup_config)`.

Infrastructure fields are **restart-required**. The authoritative list lives in `packages/harness/deerflow/config/reload_boundary.py::STARTUP_ONLY_FIELDS` and is mirrored by the standardised `"startup-only:"` prefix on the corresponding `Field(description=...)` in `AppConfig`, so IDE hover on those fields surfaces the reason inline (no need to context-switch into this table). Currently registered: `database`, `checkpointer`, `run_events`, `stream_bridge`, `sandbox`, `log_level`, `logging`, `channels`, `channel_connections`. Adding a new restart-required field requires updating the registry; drift is pinned by `tests/test_reload_boundary.py`.

**Persistence backend resolution**: the unified `database` section selects the
Gateway's LangGraph checkpointer, LangGraph Store, and DeerFlow SQL repositories.
The deprecated `checkpointer` section remains backward compatible and, when
present, overrides `database` for the LangGraph checkpointer and Store only;
application repositories continue to use `database`.

Configuration priority:
1. Explicit `config_path` argument
2. `DEER_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. `config.yaml` in current directory (backend/)
4. `config.yaml` in parent directory (project root - **recommended location**)

Config values starting with `$` are resolved as environment variables (e.g., `$OPENAI_API_KEY`).
`ModelConfig` also declares `use_responses_api` and `output_version` so OpenAI `/v1/responses` can be enabled explicitly while still using `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI`.

**Extensions Configuration** (`extensions_config.json`):

MCP servers and skills are configured together in `extensions_config.json` in project root:

Docker development mounts the project directory at `/app/project` and points
`DEER_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH` / `DEER_FLOW_EXTENSIONS_CONFIG_PATH` into that directory.
Keep mutable config files behind a directory bind mount: single-file bind mounts
can become stale or inaccessible when a host editor replaces a file on save.

Configuration priority:
1. Explicit `config_path` argument
2. `DEER_FLOW_EXTENSIONS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. `extensions_config.json` in current directory (backend/)
4. `extensions_config.json` in parent directory (project root - **recommended location**)

### Gateway API (`app/gateway/`)

FastAPI application on port 8001 with health check at `GET /health`. Set `GATEWAY_ENABLE_DOCS=false` to disable `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` in production (default: enabled).

CORS is same-origin by default when requests enter through nginx on port 2026. Split-origin or port-forwarded browser clients must opt in with `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated exact origins); Gateway `CORSMiddleware` and `CSRFMiddleware` both read that variable so browser CORS and auth-origin checks stay aligned.

**Routers**:

| Router | Endpoints |
|--------|-----------|
| **Models** (`/api/models`) | `GET /` - list models; `GET /{name}` - model details |
| **Features** (`/api/features`) | `GET /` - report config-gated feature availability (currently `agents_api.enabled`) for frontend UI gating |
| **Console** (`/api/console`) | Read-only cross-thread observability for the current user (the data layer for an operations dashboard or external monitoring): `GET /stats` - headline counters (runs/threads/agents/tokens/cost); `GET /runs` - paginated run history joined with thread titles (per-run cost); `GET /usage` - zero-filled daily token series + per-model breakdown with spend. Queries `runs`/`threads_meta` directly as a reporting layer (no new `RunStore` methods); requires a SQL database backend — returns 503 on `database.backend: memory`. Real-cost estimation reads optional `models[*].pricing` (`currency`, `input_per_million`, `output_per_million`, `input_cache_hit_per_million`; `ModelConfig` is `extra="allow"`, so no schema change) and prices each run from its `token_usage_by_model` input/output split. Pricing is **cache-aware**: `RunJournal` accumulates prompt-cache hits from `usage_metadata.input_token_details.cache_read` into a sparse `cache_read_tokens` bucket key (also threaded through `SubagentTokenCollector` → `record_external_llm_usage_records`), and cache-hit input tokens are billed at `input_cache_hit_per_million` (omitted → billed at the miss price, a conservative upper bound). Legacy rows fall back to run-level totals at `model_name`; unpriced models yield `cost: null` and cost fields are null when no pricing is configured |
| **MCP** (`/api/mcp`) | `GET /config` - get config; `PUT /config` - update config (saves to extensions_config.json) |
| **Skills** (`/api/skills`) | `GET /` - list skills; `GET /{name}` - details; `PUT /{name}` - update enabled; `POST /install` - install from .skill archive (accepts standard optional frontmatter like `version`, `author`, `compatibility`) |
| **Memory** (`/api/memory`) | `GET /` - memory data; `POST /reload` - force reload; `GET /config` - config; `GET /status` - config + data |
| **Uploads** (`/api/threads/{id}/uploads`) | `POST /` - upload files (auto-converts PDF/PPT/Excel/Word); `GET /list` - list; `DELETE /{filename}` - delete |
| **Threads** (`/api/threads/{id}`) | `DELETE /` - remove DeerFlow-managed local thread data after LangGraph thread deletion; `POST /branches` - create a new main-thread branch from a completed assistant turn checkpoint. Workspace files are not checkpointed, so the branch only best-effort copies the current workspace when branching from the **latest** turn (`workspace_clone_mode="current_thread_best_effort"`); branching from an older/historical turn skips the copy (`workspace_clone_mode="skipped_historical_turn"`) so the branch never inherits files that only exist in a later timeline; `GET /goal`, `PUT /goal`, `DELETE /goal` - read, set, and clear the active thread goal; `POST /compact` - manually summarize older active context into `summary_text` and retain the recent message window, blocked while a run is in flight; unexpected failures are logged server-side and return a generic 500 detail |
| **Artifacts** (`/api/threads/{id}/artifacts`) | `GET /{path}` - serve artifacts; active content types (`text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) are always forced as download attachments to reduce XSS risk; `?download=true` still forces download for other file types |
| **Suggestions** (`/api/suggestions`) | `GET /config` - returns global suggestions config boolean; `POST /threads/{id}/suggestions` - generate follow-up questions; rich list/block model content is normalized and inline reasoning (`<think>...</think>`, including unclosed/truncated blocks from reasoning models like MiniMax-M3) is stripped before JSON parsing |
| **Input Polish** (`/api/input-polish`) | `POST /` - rewrite a composer draft before it is sent. This is a short authenticated `runs:create` LLM request using `input_polish` config; it does not create a LangGraph run, persist a message, or modify thread state. Shares the non-graph one-shot LLM path (`deerflow.utils.oneshot_llm.run_oneshot_llm`) with the suggestions route so model build + Langfuse metadata + invoke stay in one place; validates the same stripped view of the draft it sends to the model, and preserves literal `<think>` substrings in the rewrite (`strip_think_blocks(truncate_unclosed=False)`) |
| **Thread Runs** (`/api/threads/{id}/runs`) | `POST /` - create background run; `POST /stream` - create + SSE stream; `POST /wait` - create + block; `POST /regenerate/prepare` - prepare clean input + checkpoint metadata for regenerating the latest assistant answer; `GET /` - list runs; `GET /{rid}` - run details; `POST /{rid}/cancel` - cancel; `GET /{rid}/join` - join SSE; `GET /{rid}/messages` - paginated messages `{data, has_more}`; `GET /{rid}/events` - full event stream; `GET /{rid}/workspace-changes` - workspace/output file change summary and optional diffs; `GET /../messages` - thread messages with feedback; `GET /../token-usage` - aggregate tokens |
| **Feedback** (`/api/threads/{id}/runs/{rid}/feedback`) | `PUT /` - upsert feedback; `DELETE /` - delete user feedback; `POST /` - create feedback; `GET /` - list feedback; `GET /stats` - aggregate stats; `DELETE /{fid}` - delete specific |
| **Runs** (`/api/runs`) | `POST /stream` - stateless run + SSE; `POST /wait` - stateless run + block; `GET /{rid}/messages` - paginated messages by run_id `{data, has_more}` (cursor: `after_seq`/`before_seq`); `GET /{rid}/feedback` - list feedback by run_id |
| **GitHub Webhooks** (`/api/webhooks/github`) | `POST /` - receive GitHub App / repo webhook deliveries. Verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` against `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; exempt from auth + CSRF because authenticity is enforced by HMAC. The route is fail-closed: mounted only when `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, or when explicit dev opt-in `DEER_FLOW_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_GITHUB_WEBHOOKS=1` is set. Recognized events include `ping`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, and `pull_request_review_comment`; unknown events return 200 with `handled=false`. Fan-out runtime failures return 503 so GitHub retries; permanent/non-retryable conditions such as `channels.github.enabled: false`, unknown events, malformed payloads, or unavailable channel service return 200 with a skipped/handled response. |
| **GitHub Event-Driven Agents** | Custom agents can declare a `github:` block in their `config.yaml` to bind to repos and event triggers. Webhook fan-out publishes one `InboundMessage` per matching binding to the channel bus; `GitHubChannel` routes those messages through `ChannelManager`. The response `dispatch` summarizes matched/fired/skipped agents. |

**Workspace change review**: `packages/harness/deerflow/workspace_changes/`
captures a pre-run and post-run snapshot of the thread-owned `workspace` and
`outputs` directories. `runtime/runs/worker.py` performs the filesystem scan via
`asyncio.to_thread` and writes a `workspace_changes` event with category
`workspace` when changes exist. Uploads are intentionally excluded. Text diffs
are size-limited; binary, large, and sensitive-looking paths are persisted as
metadata only.

**RunManager / RunStore contract**:
- `RunManager.get()` is async; direct callers must `await` it.
- When a persistent `RunStore` is configured, `get()` and `list_by_thread()` hydrate historical runs from the store. In-memory records win for the same `run_id` so task, abort, and stream-control state stays attached to active local runs.
- `cancel()` returns a :class:`~deerflow.runtime.CancelOutcome` enum: `cancelled` (local cancel), `taken_over` (non-owning worker claimed the run because the owner's lease expired — marks it as `error`), `lease_valid_elsewhere` (owner's lease is still alive — caller should return 409 + `Retry-After`), `not_active_locally` (heartbeat disabled, preserving the old 409 path), `not_cancellable` (terminal state), or `unknown` (not found in memory or store). `create_or_reject(..., multitask_strategy="interrupt"|"rollback")` persists interrupted status through `RunStore.update_status()`, matching normal `set_status()` transitions.
- Store-only hydrated runs are readable history. In multi-worker mode with heartbeat enabled, cancel on a store-only run can take over (mark `error`) when the owner's lease has expired past the grace window; otherwise it fails with 409 + `Retry-After`. In single-worker mode (heartbeat off), store-only runs still return 409.
- `POST /wait` (both thread-scoped and `/api/runs/wait`) drains the stream bridge via `wait_for_run_completion()` instead of bare `await record.task`, so it honours the run's `on_disconnect` setting and cancels the background run on real client disconnect rather than returning a stale checkpoint (issue #3265).
- Redis `StreamBridge` keys use a rolling retained-buffer TTL (`stream_bridge.stream_ttl_seconds`, refreshed on `publish()` / `publish_end()`) as a leak safety net, not as a run timeout. Startup orphan recovery publishes `END_SENTINEL` and schedules stream cleanup for recovered runs; malformed `Last-Event-ID` reconnect values live-tail new Redis events rather than replaying the retained buffer. Do not broaden this into a shared-database multi-pod reaper without adding worker ownership/liveness first.
- Thread-scoped run creation accepts `checkpoint` / `checkpoint_id`; Gateway validates the checkpoint belongs to the request thread before writing `checkpoint_id` / `checkpoint_ns` into `config.configurable` for LangGraph branching.
- Thread-scoped Gateway runs evaluate an active `ThreadState.goal` after the visible turn completes. `runtime/goal.py` asks a non-thinking evaluator model to judge only visible conversation evidence and return a typed blocker; the evaluator model is created once per run and reused across hidden continuation checks. Satisfied goals are cleared; every non-satisfied evaluation — continuable or stand-down — is persisted with `last_evaluation` (the blocker, reason, and evidence summary; outcomes that stop the loop additionally record a `stand_down_reason` for observability), but only `goal_not_met_yet` evaluations are streamed as hidden `HumanMessage` continuations, and only when a durable assistant end-of-turn checkpoint exists, the run has not been aborted, the thread did not change during evaluation, and the no-progress breaker has not fired. The continuation cap is 8 — a hard maximum in the `0`–`8` range; callers requesting more are clamped (`set_goal`/TUI) or rejected with 422 (`PUT /goal`). The no-progress breaker keys on the latest visible assistant evidence (not the evaluator's free-text reason, which an LLM rewords every turn), so two consecutive continuations that add no new visible assistant output stop the loop after 2 attempts. Model-response cleanup helpers such as think-block stripping and code-fence stripping live in `deerflow.utils.llm_text` so `runtime/goal.py` and Gateway suggestion parsing share the same JSON-prep behavior.

### Sandbox System (`packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/`)

**Interface**: Abstract `Sandbox` with `execute_command(command, env=None)`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_dir`. The optional `env` injects per-call environment variables (request-scoped secrets — see Request-Scoped Secrets below); `LocalSandbox` merges it via `subprocess.run(env=...)` and `AioSandbox` routes env-bearing commands through the `bash.exec(env=...)` API on a fresh session.
**Provider Pattern**: `SandboxProvider` with `acquire`, `acquire_async`, `get`, `release` lifecycle. Async agent/tool paths call async sandbox lifecycle hooks so Docker sandbox creation, discovery, cross-process locking, readiness polling, and release stay off the event loop.
**Environment policy** (`sandbox/env_policy.py`): `execute_command` no longer inherits the full `os.environ`. `build_sandbox_env()` scrubs secret-looking names (`*KEY*`/`*SECRET*`/`*TOKEN*`/`*PASS*`/`*CREDENTIAL*`) from the inherited environment before layering injected request secrets on top, so platform credentials (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) never leak into skill subprocesses. Benign vars (`PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, ...) are preserved.
**Implementations**:
- `LocalSandboxProvider` - Local filesystem execution. `acquire(thread_id)` returns a per-thread `LocalSandbox` (id `local:{thread_id}`) whose `path_mappings` resolve `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}` and `/mnt/acp-workspace` to that thread's host directories, so the public `Sandbox` API honours the `/mnt/user-data` contract uniformly with AIO. `acquire()` / `acquire(None)` keeps the legacy generic singleton (id `local`) for callers without a thread context. Per-thread sandboxes are held in an LRU cache (default 256 entries) guarded by a `threading.Lock`. Legacy global-custom mounts are gated by the same user-scoped skill discovery rule used for prompt/list visibility; providers must not infer visibility from raw directory presence alone.
- `AioSandboxProvider` (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`) - Docker-based isolation. Active-cache and warm-pool entries are checked with the backend during acquire/reuse; definitively dead containers are dropped from all in-process maps so the thread can discover or create a fresh sandbox instead of reusing a stale client. Backend health-check failures are treated as unknown, not dead; local discovery likewise treats an unverifiable container as not adoptable and falls through to create rather than failing acquire. `get()` remains an in-memory lookup for event-loop-safe tool paths. Legacy global-custom mounts follow the same shared visibility helper as local and remote providers.
- `BoxliteProvider` (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/boxlite/`) - BoxLite micro-VM isolation. The `boxlite` runtime is optional (`deerflow-harness[boxlite]`) and lazy-imported only when this provider is selected. The provider owns one private asyncio event loop on a daemon thread because BoxLite handles are loop-affine; sync `Sandbox` calls marshal onto that loop with `run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
  Boxes are named deterministically from `user_id:thread_id`, released into an in-process warm pool after each agent turn, and reclaimed only by the same user/thread. Warm-pool health checks use a short explicit timeout and forward that timeout through both BoxLite `exec(timeout=...)` and the private-loop `.result(timeout)` bridge so a hung VM cannot pin the per-thread acquire lock indefinitely.
  `sandbox.replicas` caps active + warm VMs per gateway process; if capacity is exhausted, only warm-pool VMs are evicted. `sandbox.idle_timeout` stops idle warm VMs after the configured seconds. `reset()` is intentionally a lightweight registry clear for `reset_sandbox_provider()` and does not close boxes, stop the idle reaper, or close the private loop; full teardown remains `shutdown()`.


**Shared warm-pool lifecycle:** community sandbox providers that keep released sandboxes alive for fast reuse share `deerflow.community.warm_pool_lifecycle.WarmPoolLifecycleMixin`. The mixin owns the common `DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT=600`, `IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL=60`, `DEFAULT_REPLICAS=3`, idle-checker loop, warm-pool expiry, oldest-warm eviction, replica counting, and soft-cap logging. Providers remain responsible for their own active registries, creation/discovery, health checks, and destroy hook (`_destroy_warm_entry`): AIO destroys `SandboxInfo` through its backend; Boxlite closes loop-affine `BoxliteBox` handles. AIO keeps active-idle cleanup outside the mixin and delegates only warm-pool expiry to the shared helper.

**Virtual Path System**:
- Agent sees: `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}`, `/mnt/skills`
- Physical: `backend/.deer-flow/users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/...`, `deer-flow/skills/`
- Translation: `LocalSandboxProvider` builds per-thread `PathMapping`s for the user-data prefixes at acquire time; `tools.py` keeps `replace_virtual_path()` / `replace_virtual_paths_in_command()` as a defense-in-depth layer (and for path validation). AIO has the directories volume-mounted at the same virtual paths inside its container, so both implementations accept `/mnt/user-data/...` natively.
- Detection: `is_local_sandbox()` accepts both `sandbox_id == "local"` (legacy / no-thread) and `sandbox_id.startswith("local:")` (per-thread)

**Sandbox Tools** (in `packages/harness/deerflow/sandbox/tools.py`):
- `bash` - Execute commands with path translation and error handling. For `LocalSandbox` (host bash), POSIX output is captured through bounded pipe-drain threads and stdin is `/dev/null`, so a backgrounded long-lived process (`server &`) returns immediately instead of blocking the turn on an inherited pipe, while unredirected background output is drained without growing anonymous temp files. Commands that read stdin get immediate EOF. The command runs in its own process group with a wall-clock timeout (`sandbox.bash_command_timeout`, default 600s); on timeout the whole group is killed and the agent gets a notice telling it to background long-lived processes. The bash tool description itself also instructs the model to background long-lived processes (e.g. servers) up front so it doesn't waste the turn waiting on a foreground server. See `LocalSandbox.execute_command` / `_run_posix_command` and `bash_tool`'s docstring.
- `ls` - Directory listing (tree format, max 2 levels)
- `read_file` - Read file contents with optional line range
- `write_file` - Write/append to files, creates directories; overwrites by default and exposes the `append` argument in the model-facing schema for end-of-file writes; subject to the read-before-write gate when `read_before_write.enabled` (see Middleware Chain)
- `str_replace` - Substring replacement (single or all occurrences); same-path serialization is scoped to `(sandbox.id, path)` so isolated sandboxes do not contend on identical virtual paths inside one process; subject to the read-before-write gate when `read_before_write.enabled` (see Middleware Chain)

### Subagent System (`packages/harness/deerflow/subagents/`)

**Built-in Agents**: `general-purpose` (all tools except `task`) and `bash` (command specialist)
**Execution**: Dual thread pool - `_scheduler_pool` (3 workers) + `_execution_pool` (3 workers)
**Concurrency and total delegation cap**: `MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS = 3` is enforced by `SubagentLimitMiddleware` (truncates excess tool calls in `after_model`; runtime `max_concurrent_subagents` is clamped to 2-4). The same middleware also enforces `subagents.max_total_per_run` (default 6, config schema 1-50, runtime override `max_total_subagents` clamped to the same range) against current-run entries in the durable delegation ledger, so a long lead-agent run cannot bypass concurrency limits by launching repeated legal-sized batches at each planning checkpoint, but historical delegations from previous runs in the same thread do not consume the new run's budget. The lead-agent prompt uses the same clamped values, so model-visible limits match enforcement. Gateway `run_agent()` and embedded `DeerFlowClient.stream()` both provide a per-invocation `run_id` in runtime context; `DeerFlowClient.stream()` also tags its input `HumanMessage` with that same id so durable-context capture can identify the current request boundary. Gateway resume paths may not append a new `HumanMessage`, so the worker also exposes the pre-run checkpoint's message ids in runtime context; durable-context capture uses that as the current-run boundary and never re-tags older task calls as the resumed run. When no delegation slots remain, task calls are stripped, provider raw tool-call metadata is synced, `finish_reason` is forced to `stop`, and a visible "subagent delegation limit" note is appended so the agent can synthesize already-collected results. Default subagent timeout `subagents.timeout_seconds=1800` (30 min) and built-in `general-purpose` `max_turns=150` (raised from 100/15-min so deep-research subtasks stop hitting `GraphRecursionError` out of the box)
**Flow**: `task()` tool → `SubagentExecutor` → background thread → poll 5s → SSE events → result. `task_started` carries the resolved effective model name. The per-subagent `SubagentTokenCollector` publishes a cumulative usage snapshot to the shared `SubagentResult` after every completed LLM response; the next `task_running` event carries that snapshot, so collapsed workspace cards can update without re-accounting parent-run totals. Terminal ToolMessage metadata (`subagent_model_name`, `subagent_token_usage`) and the persisted `subagent.end` event retain the model/usage after reload; absent provider usage stays absent rather than being estimated as zero.
**Events**: `task_started`, `task_running`, `task_completed`/`task_failed`/`task_timed_out`
**Handled LLM failures**: `LLMErrorHandlingMiddleware` deliberately converts provider/model exceptions into an `AIMessage` so the graph can end cleanly, stamping `additional_kwargs.deerflow_error_fallback=true` plus error metadata. Clean graph termination does not imply subagent success: `SubagentExecutor` inspects the last assistant message at terminalization and maps a marked fallback to `SubagentStatus.FAILED`, which then emits `task_failed` and the existing structured `subagent_error`. Only the marker is authoritative — error-looking assistant prose without it remains a normal completed result, so neither the executor nor frontend parses display text as a status protocol.
**Guardrail caps & `stop_reason` (#3875 Phase 2)**: three independent axes can end a subagent run early, and all now surface *why* through one additive field rather than a new status enum. **Turn axis**: `recursion_limit` on the subagent `run_config` equals `max_turns`, so exhausting the turn budget raises `GraphRecursionError` from `agent.astream`; `executor.py::_aexecute` catches it specifically (before the generic `except Exception`). **Token axis**: `TokenBudgetMiddleware` is attached per-agent via `build_subagent_runtime_middlewares` from `subagents.token_budget` (default `max_tokens` **coupled to `summarization.enabled`** — 1,000,000 when subagent summarization is on, 2,000,000 when off, warn at 0.7, hard-stop at 1.0; a user-set budget always wins regardless of the switch — #3875 Phase 3; a backstop against a subagent that burns tokens on trivial work). It does *not* raise: at the hard-stop threshold it strips the in-flight turn's tool calls, forces `finish_reason="stop"`, and lets the run complete naturally with a final answer. **Loop axis**: `LoopDetectionMiddleware` (attached at the same point) catches repeated identical tool-call sets — or one tool *type* called many times with varying args — and its hard-stop likewise strips `tool_calls` and forces a final answer without raising, recording `loop_capped`. Each guard exposes its cap on a per-`run_id` `consume_stop_reason(run_id)` accessor; `_aexecute` collects **every** middleware with that method (duck-typed via `hasattr`, so the executor has no import coupling to the guard classes) and surfaces the first non-`None` reason — adding a future guard needs no executor change. **Surfacing**: whichever axis fired, `_aexecute` stamps a normal status plus an additive reason — `completed` + `stop_reason=token_capped|turn_capped|loop_capped` when a usable final answer (or partial recovered from the last streamed chunk via `_extract_final_result` → `utils/messages.py::message_content_to_text`, returning a `"No response Generated"` sentinel when no text survived) was produced; `failed` + `stop_reason=turn_capped` when nothing usable survived. `SubagentResult.stop_reason` flows through `task_tool.py::_task_result_command` → `format_subagent_result_message` (renders `Task Succeeded (capped: ...)` / `Task failed (capped: ...)`) and `make_subagent_additional_kwargs`, which stamps the additive `subagent_stop_reason` key alongside the normal `subagent_status`. **Why additive, not an enum**: a new status value would break v1 consumers; an optional field is ignored by older frontends and ledger readers, so the cross-language contract (`contracts/subagent_status_contract.json` v2 + `subagents/status_contract.py` + `frontend/.../subtask-result.ts`, pinned by `test_status_values_match_contract` / `test_stop_reason_values_match_contract`) stays backward-compatible. The durable delegation ledger captures `stop_reason` onto the entry and renders model-facing guidance ("hit a guardrail cap with a partial result; reuse it, retry tighter, or raise the per-agent budget (`max_turns` / `token_budget`)") so the lead reuses a capped completion knowingly instead of mistaking it for a clean one. (Phase 1 shipped this surfacing as a `MAX_TURNS_REACHED` status enum in #3949; Phase 2 replaced that enum with the additive `stop_reason` field per the agreed design — the `max_turns_reached` status value and `SubagentStatus.MAX_TURNS_REACHED` are gone.)
**Context compaction (#3875 Phase 3, #4039)**: subagents inherit `DeerFlowSummarizationMiddleware` via `build_subagent_runtime_middlewares`, gated on the **same** `summarization.enabled` switch the lead reads (one config covers both chains; trigger/keep/model/prompt come from the shared `summarization` config so they cannot drift). The subagent builder attaches `DurableContextMiddleware` immediately before summarization, using the same skills path/read-tool settings as the lead chain. Compaction stores the generated summary in `ThreadState.summary_text` rather than as a `messages` item; the durable-context wrapper therefore projects it into the next model request as guarded hidden human data. This is required when a message-count keep policy preserves only an assistant tool-call plus its tool results: without the injected summary the next request begins with assistant/tool history and strict OpenAI-compatible providers can reject it. Because `DurableContextMiddleware` inserts a second `SystemMessage(authority_contract)` after the subagent's leading system prompt, the builder also appends `SystemMessageCoalescingMiddleware` innermost (mirroring the lead chain, appended after the optional summarization middleware so it is unconditionally last) to merge every `SystemMessage` into one leading `system_message` — otherwise the durable fix would trade #4039's assistant-first HTTP 400 for a duplicate-system 400 on the same strict backends (#4040). The factory is called with `skip_memory_flush=True` on the subagent path: the lead's `memory_flush_hook` (attached when `memory.enabled`) flushes pre-compaction messages into durable memory keyed by `thread_id`, and subagents share the parent's `thread_id`, so without skipping the hook a subagent's internal turns would pollute the **parent** thread's durable memory. Placement differs from the lead chain (lead appends summarization *before* the guard trio; subagent appends it *after*) — benign because the middleware implements only `before_model` (compaction) with no `after_model`/`consume_stop_reason`, so it cannot disturb the Phase 2 guard-cap stop-reason channel. Compaction rewrites the messages channel via `RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)`, which shrinks `len(messages)` below the step-capture cursor mid-run; `capture_new_step_messages` (see Step capture below) resets the cursor to the new tail on contraction so steps appended after the compaction point are not silently dropped.
**Step capture & persistence (#3779)**: `executor.py` captures both assistant turns (`AIMessage`) **and** tool outputs (`ToolMessage`) via `subagents/step_events.py::capture_new_step_messages`, which walks the *newly-appended tail* of each `stream_mode="values"` chunk (not just `messages[-1]`) so a multi-tool-call turn — where LangGraph's `ToolNode` appends several `ToolMessage`s in one super-step — keeps every tool output instead of dropping all but the last. `runtime/runs/worker.py::_SubagentEventBuffer` additionally persists these `task_*` custom events to the `RunEventStore` as `subagent.start`/`subagent.step`/`subagent.end` (`category="subagent"`, `task_id` in `metadata`). It **batches** writes via `put_batch` (flushing on a terminal `subagent.end`, at `FLUSH_THRESHOLD` events, and in the worker's `finally`) rather than one `put()` per step, since `put()` is a documented low-frequency path (per-thread advisory lock per call) and a deep subagent (`max_turns=150`) emits hundreds of steps on the hot stream loop. `build_subagent_step` caps both the per-step `text` and each tool call's serialized `args` at `SUBAGENT_STEP_MAX_CHARS` (flagged `truncated` / `args_truncated`) so a large `write_file`/`bash` payload can't produce an unbounded row. The dedicated category keeps them out of `list_messages` (the thread feed) while `list_events` returns them for the frontend's fetch-on-expand backfill. `list_events` accepts `task_id` (filters on `metadata["task_id"]` — SQL-side in `DbRunEventStore` via `event_metadata["task_id"].as_string()`, in-memory in the JSONL/memory stores) plus an `after_seq` forward cursor, so the card pages through one subagent's steps without the run-wide `limit` truncating the tail (no schema migration: the filter rides the existing run-scoped index). `step_events.py` is a pure, unit-tested layer (`build_subagent_step` / `subagent_run_event`). **History contraction (#3875 Phase 3)**: `capture_new_step_messages` assumes append-only growth, but `DeerFlowSummarizationMiddleware` rewrites the messages channel via `RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)`, shrinking `len(messages)` below the cursor mid-run. On contraction (`total < processed_count`) the cursor resets to the new tail; `capture_step_message`'s id/content dedup prevents re-emitting pre-compaction steps, so steps appended after the compaction point are still captured instead of being dropped until `total` overtakes the stale cursor.
**Deferred MCP tools** (if `tool_search.enabled`): `SubagentExecutor._build_initial_state` assembles deferral after policy filtering via the shared `assemble_deferred_tools` (fail-closed), appends the `tool_search` tool, injects the `<available-deferred-tools>` section into the subagent's `SystemMessage`, and threads the setup to `_create_agent`, which attaches `McpRoutingMiddleware` (when PR1 routing metadata matches deferred tools) before `DeferredToolFilterMiddleware` through `build_subagent_runtime_middlewares(...)`. Subagents thus withhold full MCP schemas until promotion, same as the lead agent; each task run gets a fresh `ThreadState` so promotion is isolated per run
**Checkpointer isolation**: Subagent graphs are compiled with `checkpointer=False` to avoid inheriting the parent run's checkpointer, since subagents are one-shot and never resume.

### Tool System (`packages/harness/deerflow/tools/`)

`get_available_tools(groups, include_mcp, model_name, subagent_enabled)` assembles:
1. **Config-defined tools** - Resolved from `config.yaml` via `resolve_variable()`
2. **MCP tools** - From enabled MCP servers (lazy initialized, cached with mtime invalidation)
3. **Built-in tools**:
   - `present_files` - Make output files visible to user (only `/mnt/user-data/outputs`)
   - `ask_clarification` - Request clarification (intercepted by ClarificationMiddleware, which preserves text fallback and adds `artifact.human_input` for Web UI Human Input Cards)
   - `view_image` - Read image as base64 (added only if model supports vision)
   - `setup_agent` - Bootstrap-only: persist a brand-new custom agent's `SOUL.md` and `config.yaml`. Bound only when `is_bootstrap=True`.
   - `update_agent` - Custom-agent-only: persist self-updates to the current agent's `SOUL.md` / `config.yaml` from inside a normal chat (partial update + atomic write). Bound when `agent_name` is set and `is_bootstrap=False`.
4. **Subagent tool** (if enabled):
   - `task` - Delegate to subagent (description, prompt, subagent_type)

Scheduled-task runtime note:
- Scheduled background runs set `context.non_interactive=true` and therefore exclude `ask_clarification` from the lead-agent tool list. This keeps scheduler-triggered runs from stalling on human confirmation mid-execution. `non_interactive` is an internal-only context key: it is merged from `body.context` only when the request authenticated as the process-internal user (the scheduler path), never from arbitrary HTTP/IM clients.

**Community tools** (`packages/harness/deerflow/community/`): optional integrations, each in its own subpackage and wired through `config.yaml`. Documented examples:
- `tavily/` - Web search (5 results default) and web fetch (4KB limit)
- `jina_ai/` - Web fetch via Jina reader API with readability extraction
- `firecrawl/` - Web scraping via Firecrawl API
- `image_search/` - Image search via DuckDuckGo
- `aio_sandbox/` - Docker-based isolation (`AioSandboxProvider`)

Additional providers also live here (`boxlite`, `brave`, `browserless`, `crawl4ai`, `ddg_search`, `e2b_sandbox`, `exa`, `fastcrw`, `groundroute`, `infoquest`, `searxng`, `serper`); see each subpackage for specifics.

**ACP agent tools**:
- `invoke_acp_agent` - Invokes external ACP-compatible agents from `config.yaml`
- ACP launchers must be real ACP adapters. The standard `codex` CLI is not ACP-compatible by itself; configure a wrapper such as `npx -y @zed-industries/codex-acp` or an installed `codex-acp` binary
- Missing ACP executables now return an actionable error message instead of a raw `[Errno 2]`
- Each ACP agent uses a per-thread workspace at `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/acp-workspace/`. The workspace is accessible to the lead agent via the virtual path `/mnt/acp-workspace/` (read-only). In docker sandbox mode, the directory is volume-mounted into the container at `/mnt/acp-workspace` (read-only); in local sandbox mode, path translation is handled by `tools.py`

### MCP System (`packages/harness/deerflow/mcp/`)

- Uses `langchain-mcp-adapters` `MultiServerMCPClient` for multi-server management
- **Lazy initialization**: Tools loaded on first use via `get_cached_mcp_tools()`
- **Cache invalidation**: Detects config file changes via mtime comparison
- **Transports**: stdio (command-based), SSE, HTTP
- **OAuth (HTTP/SSE)**: Supports token endpoint flows (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`) with automatic token refresh + Authorization header injection
- **Routing hints**: `extensions_config.json -> mcpServers.<server>.routing` and
  `tools.<original_tool_name>.routing` are soft preference metadata. The effective
  routing is resolved while `mcp/tools.py::get_mcp_tools()` still has both
  `source_name` and the original MCP tool name, then stored on `tool.metadata`
  under `deerflow_mcp_routing`. Prompt rendering uses
  `tools/builtins/tool_search.py::get_mcp_routing_hints_prompt_section`, which
  references `tool_search` when a hinted MCP tool is currently deferred; do not
  add a parallel routing middleware for PR1-style preference hints.
- **Stdio file outputs**: Persistent stdio sessions are scoped by `user_id:thread_id`. For stdio transports only, DeerFlow pins the subprocess default `cwd` to the thread workspace and `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP` to `workspace/.mcp/tmp/`, unless the operator explicitly configured `cwd` or temp env values. SSE/HTTP transports skip this filesystem prep entirely.
- **Stdio path translation**: MCP-returned local file references are not copied. If a `ResourceLink` or conservative free-text path resolves to an existing file inside the thread's mounted user-data tree, it is translated deterministically to `/mnt/user-data/...`; paths outside that tree remain unchanged.
- **Runtime updates**: Gateway API saves to extensions_config.json; the Gateway-embedded runtime detects changes via mtime

### Skills System (`packages/harness/deerflow/skills/`)

- **Location**: `deer-flow/skills/{public,custom}/`
- **Format**: Directory with `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter: name, description, license, allowed-tools, required-secrets)
- **Loading**: `load_skills()` recursively scans `skills/{public,custom}` for `SKILL.md`, parses metadata, and reads enabled state from extensions_config.json
- **Injection (legacy / default)**: Enabled skills are listed in the agent system prompt with full metadata and container paths (`<available_skills>` block). Controlled by `skills.deferred_discovery: false` (default).
- **Deferred discovery** (`skills.deferred_discovery: true`): Skills are listed by name only in a compact `<skill_index>` block, keeping the system prompt prefix-cache friendly. The agent calls the `describe_skill` tool at runtime to fetch full metadata for skills it wants to use, then loads the SKILL.md via `read_file`. Two new modules support this path:
  - `skills/catalog.py` — `SkillCatalog` (immutable, searchable; query forms: `select:a,b`, `+prefix`, free-text regex); `select:` returns all requested skills without a result cap; other modes cap at `MAX_RESULTS=5`.
  - `skills/describe.py` — `build_describe_skill_tool(catalog)` builds the `describe_skill` tool as a closure; `build_skill_search_setup(skills, enabled, ...)` produces a `SkillSearchSetup(describe_skill_tool, skill_names)` that is wired into both the LangGraph agent factory (`agent.py`) and the embedded client (`client.py`).
- **Slash activation**: `/skill-name task` loads that enabled skill's `SKILL.md` for the current model call only. The resolver rejects leading whitespace, missing separators, reserved channel commands (`/new`, `/help`, `/bootstrap`, `/status`, `/models`, `/memory`, `/goal`), disabled skills, and skills outside a custom agent's whitelist.
- **Installation**: `POST /api/skills/install` extracts .skill ZIP archive to custom/ directory
- **SkillScan**: `packages/harness/deerflow/skills/skillscan/` is the native deterministic scanner for `.skill` archives and agent-managed skill writes. It runs offline before the LLM scanner, emits structured findings (`rule_id`, `severity`, `file`, `line`, `message`, `remediation`, redacted `evidence` — category/analyzer are encoded in the `rule_id` prefix), blocks `CRITICAL`, and passes warning findings into `scan_skill_content()`. `scan_archive_preflight()` / `scan_skill_dir()` are pure sync functions (dispatch off the event loop); `enforce_static_scan()` applies the blocking policy and the `skill_scan.enabled` kill switch. Do not add Semgrep/OpenGrep or YAML rule-engine dependencies to the core path; Phase 1 rule specs live in Python constants next to their analyzers in `skillscan/orchestrator.py`.
- **Skill Review Core**: `packages/harness/deerflow/skills/review/` provides read-only package snapshots, deterministic facts, resource/eval analysis, report rendering, and the CLI (`python -m deerflow.skills.review.cli`). It reuses the shared frontmatter helper and SkillScan; it must not import `app.*`, execute target scripts, install dependencies, or call networks. JSON contracts live in `contracts/skill_review/`. The `review_skill_package` built-in tool labels results with `review_subject_entry` and never `skill_context_entry`, so reviewing a target does not activate it, bind its `required-secrets`, or apply its `allowed-tools`. Its model-visible `ToolMessage.content` is a compact JSON payload with untrusted control tags neutralized; the full raw review payload, including Markdown renders, stays in `ToolMessage.artifact`. CI should run the CLI with `--fail-on error --fail-on-incomplete` so blocker/error findings and truncated/not-assessed packages fail the gate. The public `skills/public/skill-reviewer` skill owns semantic readiness review and suggestions only; mutation and runtime experiments remain owned by `skill-creator`.

#### Request-Scoped Secrets (`required-secrets`)

Lets a caller pass per-request, short-lived end-user credentials (e.g. an ERP token) to a skill's sandbox scripts without the value entering the prompt, tool arguments, the executed command string, or traces (issue #3861).

- **Declare**: a skill lists the secrets it needs in `SKILL.md` frontmatter — `required-secrets:` as a string list or `{name, optional}` mappings. `name` is both the lookup key and the env var name exposed to scripts. Parsed by `skills/parser.py::parse_required_secrets` into `Skill.required_secrets` (`SecretRequirement`); malformed entries are dropped with a warning.
- **Carry**: the caller sends values out-of-band in the run request's `context.secrets` mapping (never a message). `runtime/secret_context.py` owns the contract (`SECRETS_CONTEXT_KEY`, `extract_request_secrets`). The existing `context` passthrough carries it to `runtime.context` without mirroring into `configurable`. `build_run_config` still sets `configurable.thread_id` on the context path — the checkpointer requires it.
- **Bind (point A+)**: `SkillActivationMiddleware._resolve_secret_bindings` recomputes the injection set (`runtime.context[__active_skill_secrets]`) on every model call from two unioned sources, then REPLACES the key. (1) *Slash*: the run's most recent `/skill` activation, persisted as a source on the run context (only the activated skill's **canonical container path**, never its declared secrets) so the whole tool loop after the activation call keeps the binding; a new activation replaces it. Slash reads the genuine user text via `get_original_user_content_text`; `InputSanitizationMiddleware` preserves it (`ORIGINAL_USER_CONTENT_KEY`), so activation fires even after sanitization. (2) *In-context* (autonomous invocation): skills the model actually loaded in this thread — `ThreadState.skill_context` entries. **Both sources resolve the live registry skill by normalized container path on every call** (`_resolve_registry_skill`) and bind only that skill's own declared secrets — enabled + allowlist checked for both; the `secrets-autonomous: false` opt-out (malformed values fail closed to `false`) additionally gates the in-context path but exempts explicit slash. Resolving by registry — not by trusting the source's stored data — is what makes a caller-forged `__slash_skill_secret_source` harmless (`runtime.context` is caller-mergeable; the gateway also strips caller `__`-keys in `build_run_config`), #3938. Authorization is three-gated regardless of activation style: skill **enabled** by the operator × values **supplied per-request** by the caller (`context.secrets`) × names **declared** in frontmatter (∩ semantics). Because the set is recomputed per call, a skill evicted from `skill_context` (capacity) or a caller that stops supplying a value loses injection on the next call. The injected value always comes from the caller's request, never the host environment (scrubbed first — see below), so a declared name that also exists in the host env is safe: the caller's value wins and the host value is dropped (the #3861 per-user-key-overrides-shared-key case). Missing required secrets are logged once per binding change, not injected; binding changes are recorded as a `middleware:skill_secrets` journal event (skill and secret names only, never values).
- **Inject**: `bash_tool` reads the injection set and passes it as `execute_command(env=...)`. Scope is the activation turn/run only — a run without `/skill` activation injects nothing.
- **AIO image requirement**: on `AioSandbox` the env path uses the `bash.exec` API (`POST /v1/bash/exec`), which upstream all-in-one-sandbox only ships since `1.9.3` — older images (including a `latest` tag frozen on the `1.0.0.x` line) 404 the whole `/v1/bash/*` namespace. `AioSandbox` detects the 404, remembers the capability gap on the instance, and fails fast with an actionable upgrade error instead of letting the model retry raw 404s; there is deliberately **no** fallback through the legacy shell path because none keeps the secret values out of the command string (#3921). Regression tests: `tests/test_aio_sandbox.py::TestBashExecUnsupportedFailFast`.
- **Inherited-env scrub**: `execute_command` no longer leaks the Gateway's `os.environ` to skill subprocesses — `env_policy.build_sandbox_env` drops secret-looking names (`*KEY*`/`*SECRET*`/`*TOKEN*`/`*PASS*`/`*CREDENTIAL*`/`*DSN*` + a connection-string denylist like `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`/`GH_PAT`, plus no-flag credential sources like `MYSQL_PWD`/`REDISCLI_AUTH`/`PGPASSFILE`/`PGSERVICEFILE`) so platform credentials never reach a skill; a skill that needs one must declare it.
- **Leak surfaces sealed** (verified by a real-gateway e2e run — secret reaches the sandbox but none of these): prompt (value never in a message), trace (`tracing/metadata.py` never copies `context`), checkpoint (secrets live on `runtime.context`, not graph state), audit (journal records names only), stdout (`tools.py::mask_secret_values` redacts injected values from bash output), and **run-record persistence + run API** (`services.py::start_run` stores `redact_config_secrets(body.config)` so `runs.kwargs_json` and `RunResponse.kwargs` never carry the secret).
- **Scope / non-goals**: no persistence/vaulting — values are request-scoped and never stored server-side, so long-lived use means the caller re-supplies `context.secrets` on each request while the skill stays in `skill_context`; subagents do not inherit the injection set; the MCP per-user-credential gap (#3322) is a sibling, not covered here. Tests: `tests/test_skill_request_scoped_secrets.py`.

### Model Factory (`packages/harness/deerflow/models/factory.py`)

- `create_chat_model(name, thinking_enabled)` instantiates LLM from config via reflection
- Supports `thinking_enabled` flag with per-model `when_thinking_enabled` overrides
- Supports vLLM-style thinking toggles via `when_thinking_enabled.extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` for Qwen reasoning models, while normalizing legacy `thinking` configs for backward compatibility
- Supports `supports_vision` flag for image understanding models
- Config values starting with `$` resolved as environment variables
- Missing provider modules surface actionable install hints from reflection resolvers (for example `uv add langchain-google-genai`)

### vLLM Provider (`packages/harness/deerflow/models/vllm_provider.py`)

- `VllmChatModel` subclasses `langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI` for vLLM 0.19.0 OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Preserves vLLM's non-standard assistant `reasoning` field on full responses, streaming deltas, and follow-up tool-call turns
- Designed for configs that enable thinking through `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` on vLLM 0.19.0 Qwen reasoning models, while accepting the older `thinking` alias

### IM Channels System (`app/channels/`)

Bridges external messaging platforms (Feishu, Slack, Telegram, Discord, DingTalk, GitHub) to the DeerFlow agent via Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API.

**Architecture**: Channels communicate with Gateway through the `langgraph-sdk` HTTP client (same as the frontend), ensuring threads are created and managed server-side. The internal SDK client injects process-local internal auth plus a matching CSRF cookie/header pair so Gateway accepts state-changing thread/run requests from channel workers without relying on browser session cookies.

**Components**:
- `message_bus.py` - Async pub/sub hub (`InboundMessage` → queue → dispatcher; `OutboundMessage` → callbacks → channels)
- `store.py` - JSON-file persistence mapping `channel_name:chat_id[:topic_id]` → `thread_id` (keys are `channel:chat` for root conversations and `channel:chat:topic` for threaded conversations)
- `manager.py` - Core dispatcher: creates threads via `client.threads.create()`, routes commands including `/goal` (setting a goal persists it through Gateway and then routes the objective as a chat turn), keeps Slack/Discord on `client.runs.wait()`, uses `client.runs.stream(["messages-tuple", "values"])` for Feishu/Telegram incremental outbound updates, serializes same-thread Feishu turns in-manager when the channel's `ChannelRunPolicy.serialize_thread_runs=True` so rapid follow-ups queue instead of tripping the runtime busy reply, and switches to `client.runs.create()` (fire-and-forget, returns once the run is `pending`) for channels whose `ChannelRunPolicy.fire_and_forget=True` so long autonomous runs do not hit the SDK default 300s `httpx.ReadTimeout`
- `base.py` - Abstract `Channel` base class (start/stop/send lifecycle)
- `service.py` - Manages lifecycle of all configured channels from `config.yaml`
- `slack.py` / `feishu.py` / `telegram.py` / `discord.py` / `dingtalk.py` - Platform-specific implementations (`feishu.py` tracks the running card `message_id` in memory and patches the same card in place; `telegram.py` registers the "Working on it..." placeholder as the stream target and edits it in place via `editMessageText`; `dingtalk.py` optionally uses AI Card streaming for in-place updates when `card_template_id` is configured)
- `github.py` - Webhook-driven GitHub channel. Inbound messages come from `POST /api/webhooks/github`; outbound is log-only because GitHub agents post explicitly with `gh` from their sandbox when they choose to comment or create a PR
- `app/gateway/routers/channel_connections.py` - Browser-facing user connection and disconnect APIs
- `deerflow.persistence.channel_connections` - SQL-backed user-owned connection, optional credential, connect state, and conversation store

**Message Flow**:
1. External platform -> Channel impl -> `MessageBus.publish_inbound()`
   - For GitHub, the webhook router verifies the delivery then calls `fanout_event(bus, ...)`; matching agent bindings publish one `InboundMessage` each instead of a long-polling channel worker.
2. `ChannelManager._dispatch_loop()` consumes from queue
3. For user-owned channel connections, incoming messages carry `connection_id`, `owner_user_id`, and `workspace_id`; `owner_user_id` becomes the DeerFlow run `user_id`, while the raw platform user id remains `channel_user_id`. The Gateway forwards `channel_user_id` from `body.context` into the runtime context only (never `configurable`, which is checkpointed), and `bash_tool` exposes it to sandbox commands as the fixed env var `DEERFLOW_CHANNEL_USER_ID` — via a shell-quoted command-string prefix, NOT the `execute_command(env=...)` channel, which is reserved for request-scoped secrets and would switch `AioSandbox` onto the `bash.exec` path (image >= 1.9.3, fresh session per call). Per-call injection keeps group-chat identity correct (one thread/sandbox, many senders) **without depending on the AIO shell's session semantics**: every IM-channel command carries an explicit `export VAR=<id>; ` (valid id) or `unset VAR; ` (empty / non-str / over the 256-char cap, since `body.context` is client-writable). The AIO no-env path reuses a persistent shell session (the reason for the class lock, #1433), so a bare command could otherwise resolve a stale id an earlier sender exported; the `unset` closes the window the length/type guard would open (a dropped id would inherit the previous sender's value). Non-IM runs (no `channel_user_id` in context) are left untouched. Not injected on the Windows local sandbox (its PowerShell/cmd.exe fallback has no `export`/`unset`). Propagates across `task` delegation: `task_tool` captures the dispatching turn's id and the subagent executor forwards it into the subagent's runtime context, same as the guardrail attribution fields. The var is informational, never authorization-grade: any bash command can overwrite it (and web clients can set `body.context.channel_user_id`), so skills must not treat it as authenticated identity. Tests: `tests/test_channel_user_id_env.py`
4. For chat: look up/create thread through Gateway's LangGraph-compatible API
5. Feishu/Telegram chat: `runs.stream()` → accumulate AI text → publish multiple outbound updates (`is_final=False`) → publish final outbound (`is_final=True`)
6. Slack/Discord chat: `runs.wait()` → extract final response → publish outbound
6b. GitHub chat (`ChannelRunPolicy.fire_and_forget=True`): `runs.create()` returns once the run is `pending`; the manager does not wait for the final state and does not publish an outbound. The agent posts its own reply mid-run via `gh` from the sandbox. `ConflictError` on a busy thread still trips the standard `THREAD_BUSY_MESSAGE` path (log-only on GitHub).
7. Feishu channel sends one running reply card up front, then patches the same card for each outbound update (card JSON sets `config.update_multi=true` for Feishu's patch API requirement). Messages already sent inside an existing Feishu topic carry a compact source-message preview in that card, and queued same-thread follow-ups patch their own source message's card from queued → running → final without falling back to the generic busy reply.
8. Telegram streaming: the "Working on it..." placeholder message is registered as the stream target; non-final updates `editMessageText` it in place (channel-side throttle: 1s in private chats, 3s in groups due to Telegram's 20 msg/min group cap; 4096-char truncation; rate-limited updates dropped); the final update performs the last edit and splits >4096 texts into follow-up messages
9. DingTalk AI Card mode (when `card_template_id` configured): `runs.stream()` → create card with initial text → stream updates via `PUT /v1.0/card/streaming` → finalize on `is_final=True`. Falls back to `sampleMarkdown` if card creation or streaming fails
10. For commands (`/new`, `/status`, `/models`, `/memory`, `/goal`, `/help`): handle locally or query Gateway API
11. Outbound → channel callbacks → platform reply
    - GitHub is the exception: the channel logs the final assistant message and does **not** auto-post it to GitHub. Agents use the sandbox `gh` CLI (`gh issue comment`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr create`, etc.) for intentional writeback, so silence is cheap when several agents fan out on the same event.

**Owner-scoped file storage**: inbound files, uploads, and output artifacts are staged under the DeerFlow owner's bucket so they land where the agent run reads/writes (`users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/{uploads,outputs}`). `ChannelManager._handle_chat` resolves the storage owner once via `_channel_storage_user_id(msg)` (sanitized owner id, falling back to `safe(msg.user_id)` for unbound auth-enabled channels — mirroring `_resolve_run_params`'s run identity; `None` only when no identity is available) and threads it as the `user_id=` kwarg through the file pipeline:
- `Channel.receive_file(msg, thread_id, user_id=...)` — owner-bound channels persist downloaded files under the owner's bucket instead of the default bucket
- `_ingest_inbound_files(...)` and the underlying `ensure_uploads_dir` / `get_uploads_dir` — owner-scoped via the same kwarg
- `_resolve_attachments` / `_prepare_artifact_delivery` — resolve output artifacts from the bound owner's bucket
The cached value is reused for both the blocking (`runs.wait`) and streaming (`_handle_streaming_chat`) paths, so uploads and artifact delivery always target the same bucket even if a channel returns a rewritten `InboundMessage` from `receive_file`. The bucket id matches the memory bucket resolved by `_resolve_memory_user_id` (both normalize through `make_safe_user_id`).

**Configuration** (`config.yaml` -> `channels`):
- `langgraph_url` - LangGraph-compatible Gateway API base URL (default: `http://localhost:8001/api`)
- `gateway_url` - Gateway API URL for auxiliary commands (default: `http://localhost:8001`)
- In Docker Compose, IM channels run inside the `gateway` container, so `localhost` points back to that container. Use `http://gateway:8001/api` for `langgraph_url` and `http://gateway:8001` for `gateway_url`, or set `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_LANGGRAPH_URL` / `DEER_FLOW_CHANNELS_GATEWAY_URL`.
- Per-channel configs: `feishu` (app_id, app_secret), `slack` (bot_token, app_token), `telegram` (bot_token), `dingtalk` (client_id, client_secret, optional `card_template_id` for AI Card streaming), `github` (operator kill-switch `enabled`, plus `default_mention_login` for mention-required GitHub triggers)

**User-owned channel connections** (`config.yaml` -> `channel_connections`):
- Disabled by default. It is a user-binding layer on top of the existing `channels.*` runtime config, not a replacement for provider bot credentials.
- No public IP, OAuth callback URL, or provider webhook route is required by the current implementation.
- Telegram uses a deep-link `/start <code>` flow over the existing long-polling worker. Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, and WeCom use `/connect <code>` over their existing outbound channel workers.
- Frontend APIs: `GET /api/channels/providers`, `GET /api/channels/connections`, `POST /api/channels/{provider}/connect`, and `DELETE /api/channels/connections/{connection_id}`.
- Browser APIs remain protected by normal Gateway auth/CSRF. Provider messages arrive through the already-configured channel workers.
- Provider-level `connection_status` reflects the user's newest connection row. With no binding it is `not_connected`, except in auth-disabled local mode where a configured running channel reports `connected` because all channel messages already route to the default user.
- Slack replies use the configured operator bot token from `channels.slack` unless per-connection credentials are present; unreadable or corrupt stored credentials are treated as unavailable.
- Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, WeChat, and WeCom workers resolve incoming platform identities to connection records before reaching `ChannelManager`.
- **Connect-code ordering vs `allowed_users`**: inbound workers consume a valid `/connect <code>` (or Telegram `/start <code>`) **before** applying the `allowed_users` filter, so a newly allowlisted-but-unbound user can bootstrap their first bind via the browser flow. Consequence: `allowed_users` is **not** a bind-time defense — any sender who possesses a valid code can consume it (not only allowlisted users). The bind security model rests on the code's confidentiality: `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)`, 600 s TTL, one-time `consume_oauth_state`, and codes surfaced only in the initiating browser (never echoed to chat). `allowed_users` still gates ordinary (non-bind) messages.
- **Single-active-owner transfer semantics**: an external identity is keyed by `(provider, external_account_id, workspace_id)`. The latest successful bind wins — `upsert_connection` revokes other owners' active rows for the same identity (ownership transfer). This invariant is enforced at the DB layer by the partial unique index `uq_channel_connection_active_identity` (`WHERE status != 'revoked'`), so concurrent connects from different owners cannot both end `connected`; the losing writer retries against the now-visible state. `find_connection_by_external_identity` therefore resolves deterministically.
- See `backend/docs/IM_CHANNEL_CONNECTIONS.md` for provider setup, operational notes, and the architecture diagrams (connect-code flow, single-active-owner transfer, sync vs streaming dispatch, owner-scoped file storage pipeline).

**GitHub event-driven agents** (webhook-driven IM channel):
- Custom agents declare a `github:` block in their `config.yaml` to bind to repos and event triggers; the webhook route is fail-closed by default (mounted only when `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set) and exempt from auth/CSRF because authenticity is enforced by HMAC.
- Outbound is **log-only** by design: each agent posts its own reply mid-run via the `gh` CLI from its sandbox, so the manager uses `fire_and_forget=True` and `runs.create()` returns once pending.
- See [backend/docs/GITHUB_AGENTS.md](docs/GITHUB_AGENTS.md) for the architecture diagrams: webhook → fan-out → `InboundMessage` dispatch, `preferred_thread_id = UUID5(repo, number, agent_name)` thread determinism, mention-handle precedence chain, GH token lifecycle via `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` per-call `extra_env`, and the narrow `ConflictError` (HTTP 409) thread-create race recovery.


### Memory System (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/memory/`)

**Components**:
- `updater.py` - LLM-based memory updates with fact extraction, whitespace-normalized fact deduplication (trims leading/trailing whitespace before comparing), and atomic file I/O
- `queue.py` - Debounced update queue (per-thread deduplication, configurable wait time); captures `user_id` at enqueue time so it survives the `threading.Timer` boundary
- `prompt.py` - Prompt templates for memory updates
- `storage.py` - File-based storage with per-user isolation; cache keyed by `(user_id, agent_name)` tuple
- `tools.py` - Tool-driven memory mode (`memory_search`, `memory_add`, `memory_update`, `memory_delete`) using the same storage/update primitives

**Per-User Isolation**:
- Memory is stored per-user at `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/memory.json`
- Per-agent per-user memory at `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/agents/{agent_name}/memory.json`
- Custom agent definitions (`SOUL.md` + `config.yaml`) are also per-user at `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/agents/{agent_name}/`. The legacy shared layout `{base_dir}/agents/{agent_name}/` remains read-only fallback for unmigrated installations
- Middleware mode captures `user_id` via `get_effective_user_id()` at enqueue time; tool mode resolves `user_id` and `agent_name` from `ToolRuntime.context` via `resolve_runtime_user_id(runtime)` so tool calls stay scoped to the authenticated user and active custom agent
- The `/api/memory*` endpoints resolve the owner through `_resolve_memory_user_id(request)`: trusted internal callers (IM channel workers carrying the `X-DeerFlow-Owner-User-Id` header, e.g. a bound `/memory` command) act for the connection owner; browser/API callers fall back to `get_effective_user_id()`. The header is only honored after `AuthMiddleware` validated the internal token, mirroring `get_trusted_internal_owner_user_id` used by the threads router
- In no-auth mode, `user_id` defaults to `"default"` (constant `DEFAULT_USER_ID`)
- Absolute `storage_path` in config opts out of per-user isolation
- **Migration**: Run `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/migrate_user_isolation.py` to move legacy `memory.json`, `threads/`, and `agents/` into per-user layout. Supports `--dry-run` (preview changes) and `--user-id USER_ID` (assign unowned legacy data to a user, defaults to `default`).

**Data Structure** (stored in `{base_dir}/users/{user_id}/memory.json`):
- **User Context**: `workContext`, `personalContext`, `topOfMind` (1-3 sentence summaries)
- **History**: `recentMonths`, `earlierContext`, `longTermBackground`
- **Facts**: Discrete facts with `id`, `content`, `category` (preference/knowledge/context/behavior/goal), `confidence` (0-1), `createdAt`, `source`

**Workflow**:
- `memory.mode: middleware` (default) keeps the passive path: `MemoryMiddleware` filters messages (user inputs + final AI responses), captures `user_id` via `get_effective_user_id()`, queues conversation with the captured `user_id`, and the debounced background thread invokes the LLM to extract context updates and facts using the stored `user_id`.
- `memory.mode: tool` skips `MemoryMiddleware` and registers `memory_search`, `memory_add`, `memory_update`, and `memory_delete` on the agent. The model decides when to search, add, update, or delete facts; this is opt-in/experimental and should not be described as better than middleware mode without eval evidence.
- Both modes share `FileMemoryStorage`, per-user/per-agent isolation, prompt injection, manual CRUD primitives, and the updater backend.
- Middleware mode queue debounces (30s default), batches updates, deduplicates per-thread, applies updates atomically (temp file + rename) with cache invalidation, and skips duplicate fact content before append.
- Staleness pass (same LLM invocation as the regular updater, no extra API call): when `staleness_review_enabled` is `true` and at least `staleness_min_candidates` aged facts exist, `_select_stale_candidates` selects facts older than `staleness_age_days` that are not in `staleness_protected_categories` (default: `correction`), surfaces them in the prompt, and the LLM judges each as KEEP or REMOVE. `_apply_updates` enforces the guardrail unconditionally at apply time: it intersects the LLM-returned removal set with `_select_stale_candidates` output before applying the per-cycle cap (`staleness_max_removals_per_cycle`), so protected and non-aged facts can never be deleted regardless of model behavior or the feature flag setting.
- Consolidation pass (same LLM invocation as the regular updater, no extra API call): when `consolidation_enabled` is `true` and at least one category holds `consolidation_min_facts` or more facts, `_select_consolidation_candidates` identifies fragmented categories and surfaces at most `consolidation_max_groups_per_cycle` of them (largest first) in the prompt. The LLM decides which groups to merge and proposes a synthesised fact per group. `_apply_updates` enforces guardrails: source IDs must exist and must not overlap across groups, group size is capped at `consolidation_max_sources`, the merged fact's confidence cannot exceed the source maximum, and facts below `fact_confidence_threshold` are not written.
- Next interaction injects selected facts + context into `<memory>` tags in the system prompt when `injection_enabled` is true.

**Token counting** (`packages/harness/deerflow/agents/memory/prompt.py`):
- `_count_tokens` budgets the injection. In default `tiktoken` mode, the encoding is loaded lazily and cached.
- Failed tiktoken loads are cached with a timestamp. During the fixed cooldown (`_TIKTOKEN_RETRY_COOLDOWN_S`, 600s), callers fall back to char estimation immediately instead of re-triggering the blocking BPE download; after the cooldown, transient outages can self-heal without a restart.
- In-flight loads are cached as a LOADING sentinel so concurrent callers fall back instead of spawning more blocking threads.
- Set `memory.token_counting: char` to skip tiktoken entirely and use the network-free CJK-aware char estimate.

Focused regression coverage for the updater lives in `backend/tests/test_memory_updater.py`.

**Configuration** (`config.yaml` → `memory`):
- `enabled` / `injection_enabled` - Master switches
- `mode` - Operation mode: `middleware` (default passive background extraction) or `tool` (experimental model-driven memory tools). Modes are mutually exclusive.
- `storage_path` - Path to memory.json (absolute path opts out of per-user isolation)
- `debounce_seconds` - Wait time before processing (default: 30)
- `model_name` - LLM for updates (null = default model)
- `max_facts` / `fact_confidence_threshold` - Fact storage limits (100 / 0.7)
- `max_injection_tokens` - Token limit for prompt injection (2000)
- `token_counting` - Token counting strategy for the injection budget: `tiktoken` (default, accurate but may download BPE data from a public endpoint on first use — can block for a long time in network-restricted environments, see issues #3402/#3429) or `char` (network-free CJK-aware char estimate, never touches tiktoken)
- `staleness_review_enabled` - Enable proactive staleness pruning of aged facts (default: `true`; only triggers when aged candidates exist)
- `staleness_age_days` - Age in days before a fact becomes a staleness candidate (default: 90; range: 30–365)
- `staleness_min_candidates` - Minimum aged candidates required to trigger a review cycle (default: 3; range: 1–50)
- `staleness_max_removals_per_cycle` - Maximum facts removed in a single cycle; lowest-confidence entries are kept when the LLM requests more (default: 10; range: 1–50)
- `staleness_protected_categories` - Fact categories that are never pruned by staleness review (default: `["correction"]`)
- `consolidation_enabled` - Enable memory consolidation (default: `true`; no extra API call — runs in the same LLM invocation as the normal memory update)
- `consolidation_min_facts` - Minimum facts in a category to trigger consolidation review (default: 8; range: 3–30)
- `consolidation_max_groups_per_cycle` - Maximum categories the LLM can merge in one cycle (default: 3; range: 1–10; also controls the LLM's prompt instruction)
- `consolidation_max_sources` - Maximum source facts per merge group; prevents over-merging (default: 8; range: 2–20)

### Reflection System (`packages/harness/deerflow/reflection/`)

- `resolve_variable(path)` - Import module and return variable (e.g., `module.path:variable_name`)
- `resolve_class(path, base_class)` - Import and validate class against base class

### Schema Migrations (`packages/harness/deerflow/persistence/migrations/`)

DeerFlow's application tables (`runs`, `threads_meta`, `feedback`, `users`, `run_events`, plus the four `channel_*` tables) are owned by alembic via a **hybrid bootstrap** strategy. LangGraph's checkpointer tables (`checkpoints`, `checkpoint_blobs`, `checkpoint_writes`, `checkpoint_migrations`) live in the same database but are owned by LangGraph and excluded from alembic's view via `migrations/_env_filters.py::include_object`.

**Convention**: every ORM model change (new column, new table, new index) MUST ship as an alembic revision under `migrations/versions/`. The Gateway runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically on startup; users do not run `alembic` manually in production.

**Hybrid bootstrap** (`persistence/bootstrap.py::bootstrap_schema`, invoked from `persistence/engine.py::init_engine`):

| DB state                                  | Action                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| empty (no DeerFlow tables)                | `create_all` + `alembic stamp head`     |
| legacy (DeerFlow tables, no `alembic_version`) | `create_all` (baseline tables only, backfill) + `alembic stamp 0001_baseline` + `upgrade head` |
| versioned (`alembic_version` row exists)  | `alembic upgrade head`                  |

The legacy branch handles pre-alembic databases that already have at least one DeerFlow-owned table. `create_all` runs first because stamping at `0001_baseline` makes alembic skip the baseline's own `create_table` DDL on the subsequent upgrade — so any baseline table introduced into `Base.metadata` after the user's DB was first provisioned (e.g. the `channel_*` tables from PR #1930 for users upgrading across multiple releases) would otherwise never be created, and the first request hitting that table would 500 with `no such table`. The backfill is **restricted to `_BASELINE_TABLE_NAMES`** so it does not also create tables that future revisions introduce — those revisions' own `op.create_table` would otherwise fail with `relation already exists`. A guard test pins `_BASELINE_TABLE_NAMES` against `0001_baseline.upgrade()`'s actual output, so editing 0001 to add or remove a table forces a matching update to the constant. Column-level shape (pre-#3658 vs post-#3658 vs manual-ALTER for `token_usage_by_model`) is answered by each `versions/*.py` revision via the idempotent helpers in `migrations/_helpers.py` (`safe_add_column` / `safe_drop_column`) which no-op when the change is already present and `logger.warning` on shape drift. **Adding a new ORM column / table only requires a new revision file — no edit to `bootstrap.py` is needed** *unless* the new revision adds a new baseline table (rare; only happens when a new model is part of the baseline rather than introduced by its own revision).

The empty-DB path keeps using `create_all` because `Base.metadata` is the only authoritative schema source — `create_all` renders both SQLite (JSON, type affinity) and Postgres (JSONB, partial indexes) correctly without anyone having to keep a hand-written baseline in lockstep. `0001_baseline.upgrade()` is therefore almost never executed in practice; it exists as a stamp target + chain root.

**Concurrency safety**: Postgres uses `pg_advisory_lock` to serialise concurrent Gateway instances. SQLite uses a per-engine `asyncio.Lock` for same-process startup and is best-effort across processes via SQLite's file-level write lock + `PRAGMA busy_timeout`; multi-instance deployments should use Postgres. Column revisions in `versions/` additionally use idempotent helpers (`_helpers.py::safe_add_column`, `safe_drop_column`) so repeated post-baseline changes and retries are no-ops when the change is already present.

**Authoring a new revision**:
```bash
cd backend && make migrate-rev MSG="add foo column to runs"
```
This invokes `alembic revision --autogenerate` against the live ORM models. Review the generated file under `migrations/versions/` and switch raw `op.add_column` / `op.drop_column` calls to the idempotent helpers from `_helpers.py` before committing. There is no `make migrate` / `make migrate-stamp` target on purpose — the only execution path is Gateway startup, which keeps operational mistakes off the table.

**Where things live**:
- `migrations/env.py` — alembic env, delegates filter to `_env_filters.py`, sets `render_as_batch=True` for SQLite ALTER support
- `migrations/_env_filters.py::include_object` — drops LangGraph checkpointer tables from alembic's view
- `migrations/_helpers.py` — `safe_add_column` / `safe_drop_column`
- `migrations/versions/0001_baseline.py` — chain root, matches the schema `create_all` produces from `Base.metadata`
- `migrations/versions/0002_runs_token_usage.py` — fixes issue #3682
- `persistence/bootstrap.py` — `bootstrap_schema(engine, backend=...)`, the three-branch decision + locking
- Tests: `tests/test_persistence_bootstrap.py` (branches), `tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_concurrency.py` (concurrency), `tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_regression.py` (issue #3682), `tests/test_persistence_migrations_env.py` (filter), `tests/blocking_io/test_persistence_bootstrap.py` (asyncio.to_thread anchor)

### Terminal Workbench / TUI (`packages/harness/deerflow/tui/`)

A terminal-native UI over the embedded harness, exposed as the `deerflow` console script (`[project.scripts]` in `packages/harness/pyproject.toml`). It is a UI shell over `DeerFlowClient` and does **not** fork agent behavior. `textual` is an optional dependency (`deerflow-harness[tui]`; also in the backend dev group); the console script degrades to headless help when it is absent. Full guide: [docs/TUI.md](docs/TUI.md).

**Module layout** (all layers except `app.py` are pure / Textual-free and unit-tested directly):
- `cli.py` — `plan_launch()` (pure launch-mode decision) + headless `--print` / `--json` + `main()` entry point. TTY → TUI, else headless help. Uses an **absolute** `from deerflow.tui.app import run_tui` so the `app.py` module name doesn't trip `test_harness_boundary.py` (which records relative import module names verbatim).
- `view_state.py` — `ViewState` + `reduce(state, action)`, the testable heart. Rows: user / assistant / tool / system. Title captured from `values` events.
- `runtime.py` — `translate(StreamEvent) -> [Action]` (pure) + `stream_actions()` which brackets a run with `RunStarted`/`RunEnded` and turns model errors into an `AssistantError` row.
- `message_format.py` / `command_registry.py` / `input_history.py` / `render.py` / `theme.py` — pure helpers (tool summaries, slash registry + `resolve()`, ↑/↓ history, Rich renderers).
- `app.py` — Textual `App`. Runs `DeerFlowClient.stream()` (sync) on a worker thread and marshals actions to the UI thread via `call_from_thread`. Slash palette with `/goal` management + model/thread modal pickers; priority key bindings gated by `check_action` so they never steal keys from overlays or the composer.
- `session.py` / `persistence.py` — builds the client + checkpointer and the `ThreadMetaWriter`.

**Web UI visibility**: the Web UI lists threads from the `threads_meta` SQL table (user-scoped), not the checkpointer. `persistence.py` writes a `threads_meta` row under the default user (`"default"`) into the same DB the Gateway reads — via the harness-only `deerflow.persistence.engine.init_engine_from_config()` — so TUI sessions appear in the Web UI sidebar **without** running the Gateway. Best-effort: a no-op on the `memory` backend. All DB work runs on one long-lived background event loop (a SQLAlchemy async engine is bound to its creating loop).

**Tests**: `tests/test_tui_*.py` — pure layers via plain pytest, the app/palette/overlays via Textual's pilot harness with a fake in-process session, and `test_tui_persistence.py` for the `threads_meta` round-trip.

### Request Trace Context (`packages/harness/deerflow/trace_context.py`)

Request trace correlation is controlled by `logging.enhance.enabled` at **both** entry points, gated through the shared helper `deerflow.config.app_config.is_trace_correlation_enabled` so the Gateway and embedded paths cannot drift:

- **Gateway HTTP**: `app.gateway.trace_middleware.TraceMiddleware` binds one request-level trace id per HTTP request, inheriting inbound `X-Trace-Id` when present or generating a new id otherwise. The middleware writes the final value to every HTTP response at `http.response.start`, which covers SSE / streaming responses without consuming the body.
- **Embedded / TUI / CLI**: `DeerFlowClient.stream()` mints (or inherits) a request-level trace id per turn only when the flag is on. When it is off, no fresh id is minted — a caller that explicitly wraps `stream()` in `request_trace_context(...)` still opts in, because the downstream `get_current_trace_id()` read propagates that value into Langfuse metadata regardless of the flag. Because `stream()` is a sync generator (which shares the caller's context), the id binding is set/reset around each `next()` step rather than around `yield from`: this keeps LangGraph node execution and its log records inside the binding, while returning control to the caller with the ContextVar restored — avoids cross-request leak between yields and `ValueError: <Token> was created in a different Context` on GC-driven close of an abandoned generator (regression pinned by `tests/test_client_langfuse_metadata.py::test_stream_does_not_leak_trace_id_to_caller_context_between_yields` and `::test_stream_abandoned_generator_close_does_not_raise_cross_context`).

The same ContextVar value is injected into enhanced log records as `trace_id` and into Langfuse metadata as `deerflow_trace_id`.

`logging` is registered as a **restart-required** field
(`STARTUP_ONLY_FIELDS["logging"]`): `configure_logging()` installs the trace-context
filter and enhanced formatter on root handlers only during app.py lifespan startup,
and `TraceMiddleware` captures `logging.enhance.enabled` once when the FastAPI app
is constructed (via `resolve_trace_enabled(get_app_config())` in `create_app()`,
itself a thin alias for `is_trace_correlation_enabled`). This keeps the response
`X-Trace-Id` header, log `trace_id` fields, and Langfuse `deerflow_trace_id`
coherent — a runtime `config.yaml` edit to `logging.enhance.*` needs a Gateway
restart to take effect. The `deerflow_trace_id` chain inherits this guarantee
transitively because every injection point ultimately reads the same
`trace_context` ContextVar that the middleware alone populates. `DeerFlowClient`
reads its own `self._app_config` snapshot (captured at `__init__`) through the
same helper for the embedded gate.

`deerflow_trace_id` is a DeerFlow correlation metadata key, not Langfuse's native
trace id and not a DeerFlow `run_id`. Keep the existing subagent `trace_id` field
separate: that short id is still only for subagent execution logs/status.

### Tracing System (`packages/harness/deerflow/tracing/`)

LangSmith and Langfuse are both supported. The wiring lives in two layers:

- `factory.py::build_tracing_callbacks()` — returns the LangChain `CallbackHandler` list for the providers currently enabled via env vars (`LANGSMITH_TRACING`, `LANGFUSE_TRACING`, etc.). The handlers are attached at the **graph invocation root** for in-graph runs (`make_lead_agent` and `DeerFlowClient.stream` both append them to `config["callbacks"]` before invoking the graph) so a single run produces one trace with all node / LLM / tool calls as child spans. Standalone callers — anything that invokes a model outside such a graph (e.g. `MemoryUpdater`) — keep `create_chat_model`'s default `attach_tracing=True`, which falls back to model-level callback attachment.
- `metadata.py::build_langfuse_trace_metadata()` — builds the Langfuse-reserved trace attributes for `RunnableConfig.metadata`. The Langfuse v4 `langchain.CallbackHandler` lifts these onto the root trace (see its `_parse_langfuse_trace_attributes`), but only when it sees `on_chain_start(parent_run_id=None)` — which is why the callbacks have to live at the graph root, not the model.

**Trace-attribute injection points**: both `runtime/runs/worker.py::run_agent` (gateway path) and `client.py::DeerFlowClient.stream` (embedded path) merge the metadata into `config["metadata"]` right before constructing the graph. `subagents/executor.py::_aexecute` does the same for every subagent run so subagent traces group under the parent thread's session card (carrying the parent `thread_id` → `langfuse_session_id`, the user_id captured at `task_tool` → `langfuse_user_id`, and a `subagent:<normalized-name>` trace name). Caller-supplied keys win via `setdefault`, so an external `session_id` override is preserved. Field mapping:

| Langfuse field         | Source                                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `langfuse_session_id` | LangGraph `thread_id`                         |
| `langfuse_user_id`    | `get_effective_user_id()` (`default` in no-auth); for subagents, captured from `runtime.context` at `task_tool` time via `resolve_runtime_user_id()` |
| `langfuse_trace_name` | `RunRecord.assistant_id` / client `agent_name` (defaults to `lead-agent`); for subagents, `subagent:<name>` (lowercased, `_` → `-`) |
| `langfuse_tags`       | `env:<DEER_FLOW_ENV>` + `model:<model_name>`  |
| `deerflow_trace_id`   | Current request/entry trace id from `deerflow.trace_context`; matches `X-Trace-Id` for enhanced Gateway HTTP requests. Gated by `logging.enhance.enabled` in both gateway and embedded paths via `is_trace_correlation_enabled` — off by default; embedded callers can still opt in per-turn by wrapping `stream()` in `request_trace_context(...)` |

Returns `{}` when Langfuse is not in the enabled providers — LangSmith-only deployments are unaffected. Set `DEER_FLOW_ENV` (or `ENVIRONMENT`) to tag traces by deployment environment. Tests live in `tests/test_tracing_factory.py`, `tests/test_tracing_metadata.py`, `tests/test_worker_langfuse_metadata.py`, `tests/test_client_langfuse_metadata.py`, and `tests/test_subagent_executor.py::TestSubagentTracingWiring`.

**Monocle telemetry** is a third provider, structurally unlike LangSmith/Langfuse. It is **not** a LangChain callback: `tracing/monocle.py::setup_monocle_tracing_if_enabled()` calls `monocle_apptrace.setup_monocle_telemetry()` once, which installs a **process-global OTel `TracerProvider`**, patches span serialization, and auto-instruments the openai/langchain/langgraph clients. Because that is a one-time, process-global side effect (not a per-run callback), it is initialized from the **Gateway lifespan** (`app/gateway/app.py`) — never from `build_tracing_callbacks()` — and it is **off by default**. The setup call was deliberately moved out of `agents/__init__.py`, so `import deerflow.agents` must never start tracing (pinned by `tests/test_monocle_tracing.py::test_no_import_time_setup`). The Gateway lifespan is the **sole call site** (pinned by `test_gateway_lifespan_initializes_monocle`), so unlike LangSmith/Langfuse — which attach at the graph roots and cover every path — the embedded `DeerFlowClient` and the TUI are not instrumented; embedded users who want Monocle traces call `setup_monocle_tracing_if_enabled()` themselves before running the agent.

Unlike the Langfuse metadata above, DeerFlow injects **no** per-run fields into Monocle traces — the only attribute it sets is `workflow_name="deer-flow"`; every span attribute (`span.type`, `entity.*`, token usage, span inputs/outputs, `scope.agentic.session`) is produced by Monocle's own metamodel and auto-instrumentation, so there is no DeerFlow trace-attribute layer to maintain here.

Config is env-driven like the others — `MonocleTracingConfig`, built in `get_tracing_config()` and gated by `is_monocle_tracing_enabled()`. `MONOCLE_TRACING` enables it; `MONOCLE_EXPORTERS` selects exporters (default `file` → trace JSON in `.monocle/`; also `console`, `okahu`, `s3`, `blob`, `gcs`, where `okahu` requires `OKAHU_API_KEY`). `setup_monocle_tracing_if_enabled()` stays a thin wrapper on purpose: `monocle_apptrace` already guards duplicate setup (`instrumentor.py::check_duplicate_setup`) and never force-overrides an existing global provider, so the wrapper only gates on config. Coexistence with Langfuse (v4, also OTel-based) is **verified**: whichever library initializes second reuses the existing global `TracerProvider` and attaches its own span processor, so neither side loses spans (pinned by `test_coexists_with_langfuse`). Both processors see all spans, so Monocle's exporters also capture Langfuse's spans when both are enabled. (LangSmith is a plain callback and coexists trivially.) Tests: `tests/test_monocle_tracing.py`.

### Config Schema

**`config.yaml`** key sections:
- `models[]` - LLM configs with `use` class path, `supports_thinking`, `supports_vision`, provider-specific fields
- `logging.enhance` - Optional request trace correlation (`enabled`, `format`) for Gateway `X-Trace-Id`, log `trace_id`, and Langfuse `deerflow_trace_id`
- vLLM reasoning models should use `deerflow.models.vllm_provider:VllmChatModel`; for Qwen-style parsers prefer `when_thinking_enabled.extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`, and DeerFlow will also normalize the older `thinking` alias
- `tools[]` - Tool configs with `use` variable path and `group`
- `tool_groups[]` - Logical groupings for tools
- `sandbox.use` - Sandbox provider class path
- `skills.path` / `skills.container_path` - Host and container paths to skills directory
- `skills.deferred_discovery` - When `true`, replaces the full-metadata `<available_skills>` prompt block with a compact `<skill_index>` (names only) and registers the `describe_skill` tool so the agent fetches metadata on demand. Defaults to `false` (legacy full-metadata injection)
- `title` - Auto-title generation (enabled, max_words, max_chars, model_name; null model_name uses fast local fallback, explicit model_name uses the prompt_template LLM path)
- `summarization` - Context summarization (enabled, trigger conditions, keep policy)
- `subagents.enabled` - Master switch for subagent delegation
- `memory` - Memory system (enabled, storage_path, debounce_seconds, model_name, max_facts, fact_confidence_threshold, injection_enabled, max_injection_tokens, staleness_review_enabled, staleness_age_days, staleness_min_candidates, staleness_max_removals_per_cycle, staleness_protected_categories)

**`extensions_config.json`**:
- `mcpServers` - Map of server name → config (enabled, type, command, args, env, url, headers, oauth, description, `routing`, `tools`, `tool_call_timeout`). `routing.mode="prefer"` emits `<mcp_routing_hints>` prompt guidance; if `tool_search` defers the hinted tool, `McpRoutingMiddleware` can also auto-promote matching deferred schemas before the model call. It does not hard-disable other tools.
- `tool_search.auto_promote_top_k` - Global MCP routing auto-promote breadth. Default `3`, clamped to `1..5`; applies only when `tool_search.enabled=true` and only to policy-filtered deferred MCP tools with `routing.mode="prefer"` and non-empty keywords.
- `skills` - Map of skill name → state (enabled)

Both can be modified at runtime via Gateway API endpoints or `DeerFlowClient` methods.

### Embedded Client (`packages/harness/deerflow/client.py`)

`DeerFlowClient` provides direct in-process access to all DeerFlow capabilities without HTTP services. All return types align with the Gateway API response schemas, so consumer code works identically in HTTP and embedded modes.

**Architecture**: Imports the same `deerflow` modules that Gateway API uses. Shares the same config files and data directories. No FastAPI dependency.

**Agent Conversation**:
- `chat(message, thread_id)` — synchronous, accumulates streaming deltas per message-id and returns the final AI text
- `stream(message, thread_id)` — subscribes to LangGraph `stream_mode=["values", "messages", "custom"]` and yields `StreamEvent`:
  - `"values"` — full state snapshot (title, messages, artifacts); AI text already delivered via `messages` mode is **not** re-synthesized here to avoid duplicate deliveries
  - `"messages-tuple"` — per-chunk update: for AI text this is a **delta** (concat per `id` to rebuild the full message); tool calls and tool results are emitted once each
  - `"custom"` — forwarded from `StreamWriter`
  - `"end"` — stream finished (carries cumulative `usage` counted once per message id)
- Agent created lazily via `create_agent()` + `build_middlewares()`, same as `make_lead_agent`
- Supports `checkpointer` parameter for state persistence across turns
- `reset_agent()` forces agent recreation (e.g. after memory or skill changes)
- See [docs/STREAMING.md](docs/STREAMING.md) for the full design: why Gateway and DeerFlowClient are parallel paths, LangGraph's `stream_mode` semantics, the per-id dedup invariants, and regression testing strategy

**Gateway Equivalent Methods** (replaces Gateway API):

| Category | Methods | Return format |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Models | `list_models()`, `get_model(name)` | `{"models": [...]}`, `{name, display_name, ...}` |
| MCP | `get_mcp_config()`, `update_mcp_config(servers)` | `{"mcp_servers": {...}}` |
| Skills | `list_skills()`, `get_skill(name)`, `update_skill(name, enabled)`, `install_skill(path)` | `{"skills": [...]}` |
| Goals | `get_goal(thread_id)`, `set_goal(thread_id, objective, max_continuations=8)`, `clear_goal(thread_id)` | `{"goal": {...}}` or `{"goal": None}` |
| Memory | `get_memory()`, `reload_memory()`, `get_memory_config()`, `get_memory_status()` | dict |
| Uploads | `upload_files(thread_id, files)`, `list_uploads(thread_id)`, `delete_upload(thread_id, filename)` | `{"success": true, "files": [...]}`, `{"files": [...], "count": N}` |
| Artifacts | `get_artifact(thread_id, path)` → `(bytes, mime_type)` | tuple |

**Key difference from Gateway**: Upload accepts local `Path` objects instead of HTTP `UploadFile`, rejects directory paths before copying, and reuses a single worker when document conversion must run inside an active event loop. Artifact returns `(bytes, mime_type)` instead of HTTP Response. The new Gateway-only thread cleanup route deletes `.deer-flow/threads/{thread_id}` after LangGraph thread deletion; there is no matching `DeerFlowClient` method yet. `update_mcp_config()` and `update_skill()` automatically invalidate the cached agent.

**Tests**: `tests/test_client.py` (77 unit tests including `TestGatewayConformance`), `tests/test_client_live.py` (live integration tests, requires config.yaml)

**Gateway Conformance Tests** (`TestGatewayConformance`): Validate that every dict-returning client method conforms to the corresponding Gateway Pydantic response model. Each test parses the client output through the Gateway model — if Gateway adds a required field that the client doesn't provide, Pydantic raises `ValidationError` and CI catches the drift. Covers: `ModelsListResponse`, `ModelResponse`, `SkillsListResponse`, `SkillResponse`, `SkillInstallResponse`, `McpConfigResponse`, `UploadResponse`, `MemoryConfigResponse`, `MemoryStatusResponse`.

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) — MANDATORY

**Every new feature or bug fix MUST be accompanied by unit tests. No exceptions.**

- Write tests in `backend/tests/` following the existing naming convention `test_<feature>.py`
- Run the full suite before and after your change: `make test`
- Tests must pass before a feature is considered complete
- For lightweight config/utility modules, prefer pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- If a module causes circular import issues in tests, add a `sys.modules` mock in `tests/conftest.py` (see existing example for `deerflow.subagents.executor`)

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run a specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v
```

### Running the Full Application

From the **project root** directory:
```bash
make dev
```

This starts all services and makes the application available at `http://localhost:2026`.

**All startup modes:**

| | **Local Foreground** | **Local Daemon** | **Docker Dev** | **Docker Prod** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev`<br/>`make dev` | `./scripts/serve.sh --dev --daemon`<br/>`make dev-daemon` | `./scripts/docker.sh start`<br/>`make docker-start` | — |
| **Prod** | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod`<br/>`make start` | `./scripts/serve.sh --prod --daemon`<br/>`make start-daemon` | — | `./scripts/deploy.sh`<br/>`make up` |

| Action | Local | Docker Dev | Docker Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stop** | `./scripts/serve.sh --stop`<br/>`make stop` | `./scripts/docker.sh stop`<br/>`make docker-stop` | `./scripts/deploy.sh down`<br/>`make down` |
| **Restart** | `./scripts/serve.sh --restart [flags]` | `./scripts/docker.sh restart` | — |

**Nginx routing**:
- `/api/langgraph/*` → Gateway embedded runtime (8001), rewritten to `/api/*`
- `/api/*` (other) → Gateway API (8001)
- `/` (non-API) → Frontend (3000)

### Running Backend Services Separately

From the **backend** directory:

```bash
# Gateway API
make gateway
```

Direct access (without nginx):
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8001`

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend uses environment variables to connect to backend services:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL` - Defaults to `/api/langgraph` (through nginx)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL` - Defaults to empty string (through nginx)

When using `make dev` from root, the frontend automatically connects through nginx.

## Key Features

### File Upload

Multi-file upload with automatic document conversion:
- Endpoint: `POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/uploads`
- Supports: PDF, PPT, Excel, Word documents (converted via `markitdown`)
- Rejects directory inputs before copying so uploads stay all-or-nothing
- Reuses one conversion worker per request when called from an active event loop
- Files stored in thread-isolated directories under the resolving user's bucket (`users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/user-data/uploads`). For IM channels the owner is threaded explicitly via the `user_id=` kwarg (see IM Channels → Owner-scoped file storage); HTTP/embedded callers resolve it from `get_effective_user_id()`
- Duplicate filenames in a single upload request are auto-renamed with `_N` suffixes so later files do not truncate earlier files
- Gateway HTTP uploads stage bytes as `.upload-*.part` files and atomically replace the destination only after size validation. These staging files are hidden from upload listings, agent upload context, and sandbox listing/search tools, and swept on Gateway startup if a hard crash leaves one behind.
- Gateway HTTP upload/list/delete handlers offload filesystem work through `deerflow.utils.file_io.run_file_io`, a dedicated ContextVar-preserving file IO executor. Non-mounted sandbox uploads acquire sandboxes with `SandboxProvider.acquire_async()` and offload `read_bytes()` plus `sandbox.update_file()` together.
- Agent receives uploaded file list via `UploadsMiddleware`

See [docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md](docs/FILE_UPLOAD.md) for details.

### Plan Mode

TodoList middleware for complex multi-step tasks:
- Controlled via runtime config: `config.configurable.is_plan_mode = True`
- Provides `write_todos` tool for task tracking
- One task in_progress at a time, real-time updates

See [docs/plan_mode_usage.md](docs/plan_mode_usage.md) for details.

### Context Summarization

Automatic conversation summarization when approaching token limits:
- Configured in `config.yaml` under `summarization` key
- Trigger types: tokens, messages, or fraction of max input
- Keeps recent messages while summarizing older ones
- Manual compaction uses `POST /api/threads/{id}/compact`, reuses the same
  `DeerFlowSummarizationMiddleware`, writes a new checkpoint with updated
  `messages` and `summary_text`, and bumps only those channel versions.
  The route shares the per-thread serialization gate used by `/goal` writes
  and run admission so compaction cannot race with goal updates or runs that
  read/write checkpoints.

See [docs/summarization.md](docs/summarization.md) for details.

### Vision Support

For models with `supports_vision: true`:
- `ViewImageMiddleware` processes images in conversation
- `view_image_tool` added to agent's toolset
- Images automatically converted to base64 and injected into state
