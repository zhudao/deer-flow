"""Outbox delivery worker for scheduled-task IM notifications (issue #4254).

The completion hook (``ScheduledTaskService._enqueue_run_notifications``)
only writes durable outbox rows; this worker owns the actual IM send.
Execution state and delivery state stay separated: the worker moves outbox
rows through ``pending -> sending -> sent|failed`` and never touches run or
task rows. Retries with backoff live in the repository (``mark_failed``);
the worker just claims what is due and reports outcomes.
