"""Following the truncation marker's start_line reads a long file end to end.

Pins the real contract through ``read_file_tool`` and ``LocalSandbox.read_file``:
each truncated read names the next ``start_line`` in file line numbers, so the
kept text of successive reads reproduces the file without a gap or an overlap,
including the second hop, where the ranged read is itself truncated and the
provider has renumbered its lines from 1.
