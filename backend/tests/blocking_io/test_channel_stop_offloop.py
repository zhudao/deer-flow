"""Regression anchor: channel ``stop()`` must not block the event loop on SDK teardown.

``stop()`` runs on the Gateway event loop, both at shutdown and from
``POST /api/channels/{name}/restart``, so a blocking teardown call there stalls
every run, stream and channel the Gateway serves:

- Slack: ``SocketModeClient.close()`` joins the SDK's message-processor thread
  and waits for in-flight listeners.
- Feishu / DingTalk: ``stop()`` joins the SDK thread with a 5s timeout, and
  that thread only returns on a fatal error.
- Discord: ``stop()`` joins the client thread with a 10s timeout, which a
  timed-out client close or a slow ``_run_client()`` drain can use up.

Each test drives the real ``stop()`` (and, for Slack, a real slack-sdk client).
If a join or close regresses back onto the event loop, the strict Blockbuster
gate raises ``BlockingError`` from the thread-join lock wait.
