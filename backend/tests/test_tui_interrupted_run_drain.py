"""A new send must not race an interrupted run that is still writing its thread.

Textual cannot kill a thread worker, so after Ctrl+C the synchronous agent
stream keeps running until its next event. When it is inside a long tool call,
that step still completes and checkpoints. A new run on the same thread started
meanwhile forks from the older checkpoint, and whichever run checkpoints last
becomes the thread's state, so the other turn silently drops out of it.

These tests drive the real TUI through Textual's pilot with a client that
streams a real compiled LangGraph graph backed by a checkpointer.
