"""Deterministic acceptance-criteria checks (RFC #4651 PR4).

Layer 2 of the verification stack: the lead attaches ``acceptance_criteria``
to a ``task`` delegation (PR3 wired the parameter and the prompt contract);
this module checks the decidable criteria *in code* once the subagent
completes, so a self-report can never silently pass an objectively checkable
requirement.

Leaf families:

- ``file:<path> exists`` / ``file:<path> non-empty`` — read through
  ``read_current_file_content`` (the ``ReadBeforeWriteMiddleware``
  precedent), **scoped to the shared thread workspace**: the path must
  resolve under the thread's ``workspace_path``/``outputs_path`` (virtual
  ``/mnt/user-data/...`` prefixes and workspace-relative spellings are
  normalized first). The read itself uses the sandbox-native **virtual**
  form — the local read path validator accepts ``/mnt/user-data/...``
  paths, not host paths. Paths outside the shared domain return
  ``checked=False`` (UNVERIFIED) rather than assuming cross-sandbox
  reachability — if a future isolated-sandbox provider breaks sharing,
  leaves degrade to UNVERIFIED instead of misjudging. Reads are
  byte-bounded: the size is established first (``os.stat`` on the local
  host path; a metadata-only ``stat``/``realpath`` probe in a fresh
  ``env -i`` shell on remote providers — absolute-path utilities a
  poisoned persistent session cannot steer, no content opens so a FIFO
  cannot block, regular-file type required, containment canonicalized
  against the canonical mount root, matching what the provider's own
  read path resolves); above ``_FILE_CONTENT_READ_CAP_BYTES``
  the leaf answers from the size alone, at or below it the full read
  runs, and when the size cannot be established the leaf degrades to
  UNVERIFIED — never an unbounded read.
- ``file_written:<path>`` — typed claim binding: existence + read-back
  through the same workspace-scoped read.
- ``tests_passed:<command>`` — typed claim binding: the criterion must
  anchor to a *specific recorded execution* — a matching bash execution
  (harvested by the executor from the same stamped ``ToolMessage``s the
  receipt layer reads) with ``status=success`` and a test-summary shape in
  its output tail — not merely to some successful call. Matching accounts
  for shell command structure (operator-separated segments, executables,
  arguments), so an unrelated command that merely mentions the criterion
  string (e.g. inside an ``echo`` argument or a comment) cannot anchor the
  leaf. Full parent-side re-execution stays deferred to the read-only
  verifier (RFC §6).
- Anything else is undecidable in code: ``checked=False``, rendered
  ``UNVERIFIED``, never silently passed.

Vocabulary layering: the leaf booleans are ``checked``/``holds`` — never
``satisfied``/``verified``/``passed``. Strong-positive words stay exclusive
to the runtime hard gate so the model never conflates deterministic
execution evidence with task acceptance.

All functions are pure (sandbox IO only through the injected reader/prober);
the async caller offloads the whole check with ``asyncio.to_thread``.
