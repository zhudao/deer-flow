# entry names resolved from a recovered registry would miss the (empty)
# decision map and fall back to the synchronous provider API from the worker
# thread — for a loop-affine provider a denial becomes a fail-open allow.
# Entries bind nothing for that call instead (fail closed by construction).

# _SECRETS_BINDING_AUDIT_KEY: last audited binding (skill and secret names only,
# never values) so unchanged bindings are not re-recorded each call.
# The shared slash-source context contract holds the latest slash activation,
# ONLY the activated skill's canonical container path (never its declared
# secrets — those are read from the live registry on each call, #3938). The
# injection set is recomputed every model call, but a slash-activated skill must
# stay bound for the rest of the run — the model's tool loop issues many model
# calls after the single activation call (#3861 semantics).
# _SLASH_SKILL_ACTIVATION_RUN_KEY: identity of the slash message already activated
# in this run, so the reminder injection + skill disk read + "activate" audit event
# fire once per user slash command instead of on every model call. The reminder is
# added via request.override(messages=...) for a single model call and never
# persisted to graph state, so the 2nd..Nth model call of a turn rebuilds
# request.messages from state without it — the run context is the only signal that
# survives the tool loop. All three live in secret_context so they are covered by
# REDACTED_CONTEXT_KEYS in one place.
