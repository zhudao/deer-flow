"""Layer 1 authorization for middleware-declared tools.

LangChain's ``create_agent`` folds ``middleware.tools`` into the bound toolset
*after* the host's explicit tool list was filtered
(``langchain/agents/factory.py``: ``middleware_tools + regular_tools``), so a
middleware declaration would otherwise bypass Layer 1 entirely. This module
closes that gap with a five-step pass that runs once per build, after the
middleware stack exists:

1. **Record** — :func:`layer_one_outcome` captures the ordinary pass's verdict
   as two name sets at the existing Layer-1 call site.
2. **Collect** — :func:`collect_declared_tools` reads ``getattr(m, "tools",
   ())`` off the built stack. The attribute must be a ``list`` or ``tuple``:
   LangChain's factory iterates whatever it finds as-is, so any other
   container (a ``set``, a generator, ``dict_values``, ...) would bind with
   no decision at all — that shape fails the build loudly with
   :class:`DeclaredToolViewError` rather than riding through. Entries that
   are not ``BaseTool`` instances with a usable name cannot be authorized by
   name; with authorization enabled they are warned about here and removed
   from the bound stack at view time (LangChain would otherwise convert them
   through ``create_tool`` and bind them unchecked). A contributor who needs
   a plain callable must wrap it in a ``StructuredTool``.
3. **Decide, seeded** — :func:`decide_declared_tools` submits only names the
   ordinary pass never saw, through the *same* provider instance, context, and
   app config. A name the ordinary pass already decided reuses that verdict:
   a name denied for this build stays denied for this build, whatever the
   middlewares declare (the seed also keeps a fail-closed provider failure
   from being silently undone by a recovered second call).
4. **Narrow, build-locally** — :func:`apply_declared_tool_view` returns a new
   stack. Fully-authorized middlewares keep their identity and position; a
   middleware with a denied or non-collectable declaration is replaced by an
   independent copy whose ``tools`` is a new tuple of its authorized
   declarations. The original (possibly caller-owned, possibly shared across
   builds) is never mutated.
5. **Verify after the last copy** — :func:`verify_declared_tool_view`
   re-collects declared names from the exact stack being bound (after the
   final ``normalize_middleware_state_schemas``) and raises
   :class:`DeclaredToolViewError` if any survived narrowing. This is the
   backstop for third-party ``__copy__`` implementations that rebuild from
   constructor arguments and would otherwise restore denied declarations
   during ``delta`` normalization.

Copy contract for declaring middlewares: ``copy.copy`` must return an
*independent* instance that *preserves current instance state*. A ``__copy__``
returning ``self`` is rejected at view time; one that rebuilds from
constructor arguments is caught by the post-chain verification; one that
raises fails the build loudly. The narrowed assignment is safe by
precondition: it writes ``clone.__dict__["tools"]`` directly (bypassing
``__setattr__`` overrides and property setters) and only after
``inspect.getattr_static`` confirms no data descriptor named ``tools`` exists
on the class — a forwarding property would redirect the write into storage a
shallow copy shares, so that shape is refused *before any write* and the
build fails with the caller's instance fully intact.

When ``authorization.enabled`` is not true the ordinary pass returns
``provider=None`` and every step here is skipped: nothing is collected,
nothing is narrowed, and the stack handed to ``create_agent`` is the original
list object (:func:`narrow_declared_tools` returns it unchanged).
