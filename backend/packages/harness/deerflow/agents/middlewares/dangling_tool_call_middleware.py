"""Middleware to fix dangling tool calls in message history.

A dangling tool call occurs when an AIMessage contains tool_calls but there are
no corresponding ToolMessages in the history (e.g., due to user interruption or
request cancellation). This causes LLM errors due to incomplete message format.

This middleware intercepts the model call to detect and patch such gaps by
inserting synthetic ToolMessages with an error indicator immediately after the
AIMessage that made the tool calls, ensuring correct message ordering.

Note: Uses wrap_model_call instead of before_model to ensure patches are inserted
at the correct positions (immediately after each dangling AIMessage), not appended
to the end of the message list as before_model + add_messages reducer would do.
