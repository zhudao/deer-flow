"""Contract for the memory capture pre-screen: a cost gate, never a safety gate.

The pre-screen answers one question — "is this batch worth paying for an
extraction call?" — and nothing else. Its failure direction is therefore
**extraction**: an error, a deadline, an unusable response, an over-limit batch, or
no verdict at all means "extract as usual" (design L2). It gates no execution and
no write, and it never replaces the post-extraction confidence / scope /
durability / authority gates (L6).

Host contract, consumed by the DeerMem updater through the memory-layer judge:

* :class:`MemoryPrescreenRequest` — what the host knows about the batch;
* :class:`MemoryPrescreenDecision` — the verdict, or ``None`` for "no opinion";
* :class:`MemoryPrescreenProvider` — duck-typed, resolved by class path.

The operator-facing modes and the pre-``enforce`` gates are documented in
``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md``; the module invariants are in
``agents/memory/AGENTS.md``.
