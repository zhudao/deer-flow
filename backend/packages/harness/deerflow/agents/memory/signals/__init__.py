"""Jev memory signal classification: reinforcement / weakening hints over one batch.

The classifier is a *hint* source and, in one narrow case (pre-screen ``enforce``
× classifier ``hints``), a **veto** over a skip. It never decides extraction, never
drives deletion, and never participates in the reinforcement evidence gate.

The memory-layer coordinator in this package owns request combination and the
combined cache; each adapter keeps its own cache when the sides are not combined.

See ``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`` and ``agents/memory/AGENTS.md``.
