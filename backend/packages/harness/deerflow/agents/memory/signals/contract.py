"""Contract for Jev memory signal classification (reinforcement / weakening hints).

This side is **additive only**: a model verdict can add hint text and — under
pre-screen ``enforce`` × classifier ``hints`` — veto a skip. It never decides
extraction on its own, never drives deletion, and never participates in the
reinforcement evidence gate (locks S2-S5, §3 of the design).

Host contract, consumed through the memory-layer judge:

* :class:`MemorySignalRequest` — what the host knows about the batch;
* :class:`MemorySignalDecision` — hint labels, or ``None`` for "no model result";
* :class:`MemorySignalProvider` — duck-typed, resolved by class path.

See ``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`` for the modes, the separate
``hints`` evidence requirement and the pre-``enforce`` gates, and
``agents/memory/AGENTS.md`` for the invariants.
