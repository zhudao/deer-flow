"""Shared pieces for the memory judging hooks: pre-screening and signal classification.

Both hooks judge **the same batch text**, build **the same wire state** and need
**the same kind of answer cache**, so those three things live here instead of
three times over (two adapters plus the coordinator).

What deliberately does **not** live here: the questions, rubrics, thresholds,
decision direction, modes, and failure policy. Pre-screening skips a call when the
text looks worthless (failure ⇒ extract as usual); signal classification only adds
hint text (failure ⇒ fall back to the deterministic signals). Those are adapter
policy, documented in:

* the pre-screen: ``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md``, ``prescreen/contract.py``
* the classifier: ``backend/docs/MEMORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md``, ``signals/contract.py``
