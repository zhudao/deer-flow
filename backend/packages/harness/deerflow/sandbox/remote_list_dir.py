"""Remote ``list_dir`` find command and stdout contract.

Remote providers list with ``find ... | head`` under ``sh -lc``. POSIX ``sh``
does not enable ``pipefail``, so the pipeline's exit code is ``head``'s, not
``find``'s. A missing ``find`` binary (127) then looks like an empty listing
and becomes ``FileNotFoundError``.

The command below writes ``find``'s own status after the bounded listing so
callers can tell a missing path from a command failure. ``head`` closing the
pipe can kill ``find`` with SIGPIPE (141); that is a successful truncation,
not an error.
