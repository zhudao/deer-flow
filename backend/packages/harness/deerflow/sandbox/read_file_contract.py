    Uses ``count("\\n") + (1 if not endswith("\\n") else 0)`` — matching the
    ``newline="\\n"`` line iteration used by ``LocalSandbox.read_file`` and the formula in
    ``_truncate_read_file_output``.  This ensures the line count shown in the gate
    block message agrees with the ``start_line``/``end_line`` values the model can
    pass back to ``read_file``.

    Unlike ``splitlines()``, this function does not treat ``\\f``, ``\\v``, ``\\x85``,
    ``\\u2028``, or ``\\u2029`` as line separators — consistent with LocalSandbox's
    line iteration where those characters are just regular content.
