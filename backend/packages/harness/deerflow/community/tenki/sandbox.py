"""``TenkiSandbox`` — DeerFlow :class:`Sandbox` backed by a Tenki cloud sandbox.

Tenki's Python SDK (the ``tenki`` distribution, which ships the
``tenki_sandbox`` module) is synchronous, so — unlike
``community/boxlite`` — this adapter calls the SDK directly with no event-loop
bridge. File transport uses Tenki's native ``sandbox.fs`` API (``read_text`` /
``read_stream`` / ``write_stream`` / ``mkdir`` / ``stat``), which is binary-safe
and streams, so no base64/shell encoding is involved. Directory and content
*search* (``list_dir`` / ``glob`` / ``grep``) still shells out to ``find`` /
``grep`` — the fs API is single-level and has no content search — and is parsed
with the shared ``deerflow.sandbox.search`` helpers, the same approach as
``community/e2b_sandbox``. Those commands use only busybox-portable flags so any
Tenki base image works.

The Tenki SDK is not imported at module load (only its exception *class names*
are matched, as strings), so importing this package never requires
``tenki`` to be installed — it is needed only once the provider is
selected and a sandbox is actually created.
