"""describe_skill — deferred skill metadata retrieval at runtime.

Builds the ``describe_skill`` tool as a closure over a :class:`SkillCatalog`.
The tool returns structured metadata (description, allowed tools, file location)
so the LLM can decide whether to ``read_file`` the full SKILL.md.

Shares query forms, ``Command`` + ``ToolMessage`` return shape, and fail-safe
degradation with ``build_tool_search_tool`` from ``tool_search.py``. Skill
queries intentionally rank literal intent terms rather than matching regexes.
