"""Shared TypeSafe (Jev) client for every host-side consumer.

One transport layer, several adapters:

* ``guardrails/typesafe.py`` — the pre-execution tool risk gate.
* ``agents/memory/prescreen/`` — the memory capture pre-screen (planned).
* ``agents/memory/signals/`` — signal classification and its coordinator (planned).

**Shared** (this package): client lifecycle and ``transport_factory`` injection,
authentication, retry and backoff, the deadline budget, response parsing and the
error taxonomy, UTF-8 wire-size counting, and the request skeleton.

**Not shared — it stays in each adapter, on purpose:**

* **State content**: tool-call arguments for the gate, the conversation tail for
  the memory consumers. The client never inspects what it sends.
* **Questions, criteria, thresholds and decision direction**: ``risky_tool_call``
  denies at or above its threshold, ``memory_worth_keeping`` skips below its own —
  opposite directions over the same transport.
* **Failure policy**: the gate fails closed (error ⇒ deny); the memory paths fail
  softly (error ⇒ carry on with their normal behaviour).
* **Cache semantics**: the gate's provider owns its cache, the memory layer's
  coordinator owns the combined-request cache. Different keys, different owners,
  so no cached verdict is ever shared between consumers by accident.
* **Business audit**: what a decision records (the gate's run-journal reason, the
  memory pre-screen's record) and how it relates to the journal or metrics.

A change that would move one of those into this package is a change to the design,
not a refactor (see the "Shared client" section of ``backend/docs/GUARDRAILS.md``
§2.2). Caching, pooling and per-consumer policy parameters must stay out.
