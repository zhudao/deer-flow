"""The shared TypeSafe (Jev) transport client: one request, one answer set.

What this layer owns — transport and lifecycle, authentication, retry and
backoff, the deadline budget, response parsing and the error taxonomy, UTF-8 wire
size counting, and the request skeleton (design §2.1).

What it deliberately does **not** own (design §2.2): state content, the
questions, criteria and thresholds, the failure policy that turns a failure into a
denial or a fallback, cache semantics, and business audit. Those stay in each
adapter, which is why this module has no branch that knows what a "risky tool
call" or a "memory worth keeping" is.

Consequences worth keeping in mind when editing:

* **Clients live for exactly one evaluation.** The framework has no provider
  lifecycle hook, and httpx closes an injected transport when its client closes,
  so a shared transport instance would be dead on the second evaluation.
  ``transport_factory`` is a factory, called once per network-needing evaluation
  and closed together with the client it was handed to. There is no connection
  pool here (design §3.3).
* **Timeouts are budgets, not guarantees.** The async path cancels the in-flight
  request through ``asyncio.timeout``. The sync path cannot preempt a blocking
  call, so it checks the deadline after the response headers, before each piece of
  the body read, and again after parsing — and drops a result that arrived late
  instead of adopting it.
* **A question-level failure is data, not an exception** (design §2.3). One
  malformed answer must not discard the other valid answers in the same response;
  the consumer decides what "no result for this question" means.
* **The response body is bounded and never decoded.** A 200 is not a reason to
  read a body into memory: the client asks for `identity`, refuses a non-identity
  `Content-Encoding`, and stops past ``MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES``. A body that is not a
  usable envelope is a request-level ``invalid_response`` failure, not a verdict.
* **Wire size is a counting capability only** (design §2.4). No consumer's limit
  unit moves because this module exists.
