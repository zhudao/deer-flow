### Port Allocation Bounds

`network.py::PortAllocator.allocate` caps its exclusive search endpoint at
65536. A valid start near 65535 must report exhaustion with `RuntimeError`
when all remaining ports are reserved or occupied, without probing invalid
TCP ports. Keep the last valid port allocatable and preserve `max_range`.
Regression coverage lives in `tests/test_port_allocator_bounds.py`.

### Goal Objective Validation

`goal_objective.py` owns the dependency-free normalized 4000-character objective
validation shared by runtime and scheduled-task capability/repository admission.
`runtime.goal` re-exports the helper for compatibility. Validation does not replace
the saved original text; blank or over-limit text is rejected before persistence.

### Message Text Extraction

`message_content_to_text` takes raw message content and treats `None` as empty
text so downstream empty-result, error-detail, and archive-skip fallbacks work.
Keep its other conversions unchanged, including newline-separated list blocks
and literal strings such as `"None"`. Do not replace it with `message_to_text`,
which takes a whole message and uses different list/mapping semantics.
Regression coverage lives in `tests/test_utils_messages.py`,
`tests/test_subagent_executor.py`, and `tests/test_task_continuity.py`.

`llm_text.py::strip_think_blocks` scans opening and closing tags forward so
repeated unclosed `<think>` prefixes in model output do not rescan the same
suffix. Keep its case-insensitive tag handling, optional whitespace before
the closing `>`, and the `truncate_unclosed` behavior. Regression coverage
lives in `tests/test_utils_llm_text.py`.

Display summaries use `strip_leading_think_blocks` before limiting text;
`test_run_journal_visible_summary.py` preserves literal tags in the answer.

### Agent / Tool Assembly Off-Load

`start_run` also resolves the factory through `run_assembly` before admission:
cold imports cannot occupy the loop or its default pool, and import errors
cannot admit a run. `tests/blocking_io/test_agent_factory_resolve_offloop.py`
pins offload, executor isolation, request context, and failure ordering.

Tool and agent assembly re-enters `get_available_tools()` and may block on MCP discovery, so the four async assembly entry points — `run_agent`'s `agent_factory` call, `task_tool`, durable batch `_execute_item`, and `abuild_checkpoint_state_accessor` — dispatch through `deerflow.utils.assembly_io.run_assembly`, a dedicated ContextVar-preserving bounded executor (`DEER_FLOW_ASSEMBLY_WORKERS`, default 8) rather than the loop's default executor; a hung MCP server therefore parks an assembly worker instead of queueing unrelated default-executor work, and the pool logs a warning when pending assemblies exceed the worker count. `tests/blocking_io/test_tool_assembly_offloop.py` pins all four offloads plus the ContextVar propagation.

### Uploaded Document Summaries

Outlines skip root-level HTML comment blocks (`<!--` with up to three leading
spaces through the first `-->` line). Comment contents cannot open code fences;
comment markers inside fenced code cannot open comment blocks. Keep line numbers
and limits unchanged. Coverage: `tests/test_file_outline_html_comments.py`.

`file_outline.py` reads outlines and fallback previews as `utf-8-sig` so an
optional leading UTF-8 BOM cannot hide a first-line heading or code fence, or
occupy a preview line. Preserve physical line numbers, embedded U+FEFF
characters, and the original file bytes.

All outline heading styles skip root-level indented code (four leading spaces
or a tab after up to three spaces), including PDF-style single and split bold
headings. Keep legitimate bold headings with up to three spaces and the shared
conversion-companion path working. Regression coverage lives in
`tests/test_file_outline_indented_bold.py`.

Split-bold headings reject numeric/punctuation/currency-only blocks after the
section number, including parentheses, signs, leading whitespace, and `$€£¥`.
Apply the check to the second through fourth blocks; preserve the four-block
limit, punctuated titles containing text, and non-ASCII titles. Coverage lives
in `tests/test_file_outline_split_bold.py`.

### Active Content MIME Types

`text_detection.py::_is_active_content_mime_type` is the shared download-safety
boundary for artifacts and project documents. Keep platform aliases such as
Windows' `image/svg` aligned with their standard active type (`image/svg+xml`),
and preserve the generic `+xml` rule.

### Conversion Worker Ownership

`convert_file_to_markdown` drains large-file conversion workers across caller
cancellation before returning control to source-file cleanup. Keep conversion
inside `await_drained`, including when the worker fails or cancellation repeats;
upload ingestion owns a temporary source that it removes in `finally`. Coverage
lives in `tests/test_file_conversion_cancellation.py`.

### Host Path Portability

`host_paths.extended_length_path()` provides lexical Windows filesystem
spelling (absolute `\\?\` drive paths or `\\?\UNC\` shares); it is a no-op
on POSIX. It does not replace symlink resolution or confinement checks and
must not be used for persisted relative paths or Docker mount sources.
Existing extended (`\\?\`) and device (`\\.\`, including named pipes)
namespaces pass through unchanged before normalization.

`host_paths.py` rejects Windows device names for host-visible creation paths on
every platform, including the `COM`/`LPT` aliases with superscript ¹, ² and ³.
The console aliases `CONIN$` and `CONOUT$` are reserved too; match them
case-insensitively before the first dot, without rejecting longer ordinary
names such as `CONIN$notes.txt`.
Device-name comparison ignores ASCII spaces before the first dot, so
`NUL .txt` and `COM1  .log` remain reserved. Trim the comparison stem only,
not the supplied filename; ordinary names such as `report .txt` and
non-ASCII whitespace remain unchanged.
Do not normalize arbitrary Unicode digits into device numbers: names such as
`COM⁴.txt` and `COM¹notes.txt` are ordinary portable names. Read/removal callers
retain their existing portability exemptions.
