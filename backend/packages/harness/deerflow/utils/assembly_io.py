    Tool and agent assembly re-enters ``get_available_tools()``, which may
    block for the full MCP discovery duration (a slow or hung stdio server
    parks a worker until the MCP timeout). Dispatching those hops onto the
    loop's **default** executor lets a few parked assemblies queue every other
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` / ``run_in_executor(None, ...)`` caller behind them
    and reintroduce a loop-wide stall through a different door; this pool
    keeps the capacity explicit and bounds the blast radius, mirroring
    ``utils/file_io.py`` and ``tools/sync.py``.

    ``asyncio.to_thread`` copies ``ContextVar`` values automatically; raw
    ``loop.run_in_executor`` does not. Copy the current context explicitly so
    agent-assembly helpers such as ``bind_agent_build_extensions`` keep
    working inside the worker thread.
