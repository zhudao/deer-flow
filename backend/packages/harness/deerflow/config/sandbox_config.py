        allow_host_bash: Enable host-side bash execution for LocalSandboxProvider.
            Dangerous and intended only for fully trusted local workflows.

    AioSandboxProvider and BoxliteProvider shared options:
        image: Sandbox image to use (Docker/AIO image or BoxLite OCI image)
        replicas: Maximum active + warm sandboxes/VMs per gateway process (default: 3). When the limit is reached, warm/least-recently-used sandboxes are evicted to make room; active sandboxes are not forcibly stopped.
        idle_timeout: Idle timeout in seconds before released warm sandboxes/VMs are stopped (default: 600 = 10 minutes). Set to 0 to disable.
        environment: Environment variables to inject into the sandbox (values starting with $ are resolved from host env)

    BoxliteProvider specific options:
        health_check_skip_seconds: Optional reclaim-time skip window in seconds for recently released warm VMs. Default behavior is 0.0 = always validate before reuse.

    AioSandboxProvider specific options:
        port: Base port for sandbox containers (default: 8080)
        container_prefix: Prefix for container names (default: deer-flow-sandbox)
        mounts: List of volume mounts to share directories with the container
