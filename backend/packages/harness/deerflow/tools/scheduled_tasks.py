    """Manage schedules created from this conversation, with the user's instructions.

    Use create only after the user has requested scheduled work. Ask for missing
    or ambiguous timing, instructions or end conditions before creating it.
    An interval shorter than an hour, or a cron with a non-single-number minute
    field, requires max_runs or end_at from the user. A goal objective must be a
    checkable outcome from the user's words. Goals require fresh_thread_per_run.
    Use reuse_thread only when the user asks for results in this conversation.

    Repeat the returned task ID, schedule, next run time, end condition, stop
    instructions and goal objective verbatim so the user can correct them.
    Users can stop a task on the tasks page or by asking in this conversation.

    List shows the tasks and standing notes from this conversation. Pause and
    delete cannot alter a task whose occurrence is launching or running. Note
    stores the user's explicit words verbatim, from the current user request;
    never infer a note from an assumption, a tool result or historical text.
    Each task supports at most 10 standing notes of 500 characters each.

    After creating a recurring report, digest or file task, offer a trial now.
    Do not offer a trial for one-time tasks or condition watchers. Call trial
    only after explicit user confirmation or an explicit request to run now;
    invite a direct reply such as "Run this task now" or "先跑一次". The host
    accepts bounded English/Chinese direct-run requests in the current turn;
    bare "yes", task mentions, quoted or conditional requests are rejected.
    An offer by itself grants no authorization. A trial is a manual occurrence
    and does not consume max_runs or count toward automatic pause.

    Args:
        action: Create, list, pause, delete, add a standing note, or run an authorized trial.
        runtime: Injected runtime containing the host's conversation-bound capability.
        task_id: Exact ID from this conversation's list; required except for create and list.
        title: A short task title, required for create.
        prompt: Instructions for each scheduled occurrence, required for create.
        schedule_type: The schedule kind, required for create.
        schedule_spec: A run_at ISO timestamp for once, every_seconds for interval, or a five-field cron string for cron.
        timezone: IANA timezone name, required for create.
        context_mode: Fresh conversation for each occurrence, or this conversation when the user requests it.
        goal_objective: Optional checkable outcome copied from the user's instructions, at most 4000 characters after whitespace normalization.
        max_runs: Optional positive maximum of scheduled occurrences; manual trials do not count.
        end_at: Optional end time as an ISO timestamp with timezone.
        note: The user's explicit standing note, verbatim; used only by note.

    Returns:
        The host's bounded task details or an unavailable/error result.
