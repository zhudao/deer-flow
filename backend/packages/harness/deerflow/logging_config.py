# httpx logs ``HTTP Request: GET <full URL> HTTP/x.x <status> <duration>`` at
# INFO before any response handling runs, and urllib3 logs
# ``Redirecting <url> -> <url>`` at INFO when a redirect is followed. Inbound
# media URLs are signed — the credentials live in the query string, and the
# repo-wide inbound-media rule is that no part of a media URL beyond its host
# may reach the logs — so even successful downloads would leak unless the
# record itself is rewritten. The authority is split so userinfo (basic-auth
# ``user:pass@`` credentials, accepted by httpx for MCP/extension/community-
# tool endpoints) is blanked too, not just the path and query. ``rest`` is
# optional so an authority-only URL (``scheme://user:pass@host`` — no path)
# is still rewritten; a bare credential-free origin passes through as-is.
# ``rest`` treats a quote as a closing mark only at a boundary — followed by
# whitespace, a closing parenthesis, or end of string — so URLs wrapped in
# surrounding prose or a format's own quoting (urllib3's
# ``Incremented Retry for (url='…')``) keep their closing punctuation, while
# a quote EMBEDDED in the URL (``/path'quoted'?token=…``) is consumed and
# everything after it stays redacted.

# urllib3's per-request DEBUG line (connectionpool.py:545 on urllib3 2.7.0)
# splits the URL across the format string:
# ``'%s://%s:%s "%s %s %s" %s %s'`` renders as
# ``scheme://host:port "GET /private/x?token=y HTTP/1.1" 200 None`` — the
# authority and the signed origin-form target are two separate args. The
# absolute-URL regex above cannot see either half: the authority is followed
# by a space (so ``rest`` never matches and the bare-origin early return
# applies) and the quoted target has no scheme. The request line therefore
# gets its own shape — authority immediately followed by a quoted
# ``METHOD target HTTP/x.x`` line — rewritten to scheme + host with the
# target collapsed to ``/<redacted>``. The method class is case-tolerant:
# HTTP methods are case-sensitive tokens, and callers may pass lowercase
# custom methods through to urllib3.

# urllib3's retry sites log the request target with NO scheme and NO request-
# line scaffolding, so neither pattern above can see it (installed 2.7.0):
# - ``Retry: %s`` — connectionpool.py:954, DEBUG, origin-form target.
# - ``Incremented Retry for (url='%s'): %r`` — util/retry.py:545, DEBUG via
#   the ``urllib3.util.retry`` logger; the target is origin-form on the
#   request path and absolute on the redirect path (poolmanager resolves the
#   Location before retrying). The url capture applies the same boundary
#   idea as ``rest``, narrowed to this format's fixed ``')`` closer: an
#   embedded quote is consumed, the closing quote is the one directly
#   followed by ``)``. Absolute targets are left for the generic absolute-
#   URL pass — its ``rest`` stops at the closing quote — while origin-form
#   targets collapse to ``/<redacted>``.
# - ``Retrying (%r) after connection broken by '%r': %s`` —
#   connectionpool.py:869, **WARNING**, so it passes the Gateway's INFO root
#   without DEBUG being enabled; the greedy prefix groups pin the split to
#   the final ``': `` so an error repr containing quotes cannot shift it.

# urllib3's ``Redirecting %s -> %s`` (poolmanager.py:500 at INFO,
# connectionpool.py:922 at DEBUG) can carry an origin-form target in either
# slot: connectionpool passes the origin-form request target, and the Location
# header may itself be a relative reference (RFC 9110 allows it). The generic
# absolute-URL pass only sees scheme-bearing halves, so origin-form slots
# collapse to ``/<redacted>`` here; absolute slots are left for that pass.
# The pattern keeps the ``^Redirecting `` prefix anchor — the urllib3-owned
# literal — because an ``-> /path`` arrow is not urllib3-owned shape:
# non-URL logs render it too (sandbox mount mappings log
# ``sandbox.mounts entry <host_path> -> <container_path>``), and a substring
# match rewrote the container path in that actionable error (CI round 11).
# The tail is deliberately loose: ``redirect_location`` is the raw Location
# header string, and interior spaces are legal field syntax a misbehaving
# server can emit — a whitespace-strict tail would void the pass entirely
# and leak the origin-form request target in the first slot (round 13). A
# space-carrying second slot collapses whole when it starts with ``/``. The
# first slot gets the same grammar treatment: the recursive urlopen frame
# passes the previous raw Location as its url, so t1 can carry interior
# spaces too — it is lazy, splitting at the FIRST `` -> `` the way the
# line was constructed left to right.

# The two scheme-bearing patterns start with a character class, so re.sub
# retries the match at every position of a long token — a letter run with no
# ``://`` makes each attempt walk to the end of the run, which is quadratic
# overall (a 64K-character path or error body costs seconds per record, and
# this filter runs synchronously in every root handler). Both are instead
# driven from the literal ``://`` occurrences: each one walks back over the
# scheme charset to the first letter of its maximal run, and the pattern is
# attempted only there. A regex match can only start at such a position, and
# if it fails at the run's first letter it fails identically at every other
# letter of the run (the scheme group is the only part that differs), so this
# reproduces re.sub's leftmost-non-overlapping result in linear time. The
# span-skip below is safe for the same reason: a match of either pattern
# always ends at a character outside the scheme charset (whitespace, quote,
# ``/``, ``?``, ``#``, or end of string — never a letter/digit/``+``/``-``/
# ``.``), so a scheme run — and with it a candidate start — can never
# straddle a previous match's end; re.sub likewise never re-enters a
# consumed span.

    splits or disassembles the URL across several of its own log formats, and
    the generic absolute-URL pattern only sees a scheme-bearing URL in one

# The filter class is generic over the formatted message, so it serves any
# HTTP client library whose records embed full URLs. Where it must be
# ATTACHED differs per library, because a logging.Filter on a logger only
# runs for records emitted through that exact logger — it is not inherited
# by child loggers and never sees propagated records:
# - httpx emits via the bare ``httpx`` logger, so a logger filter works.
# - urllib3 emits via children (``urllib3.poolmanager`` logs
#   ``Redirecting <url> -> <url>`` at INFO, ``urllib3.connectionpool`` logs
#   redirect lines, the per-request authority/quoted-target line, and the
#   ``Retry:``/``Retrying`` lines at DEBUG/WARNING, and ``urllib3.util.retry``
#   logs ``Incremented Retry for (url=…)`` at DEBUG), so a filter on bare
#   ``urllib3`` is dead code. Handler-level filters DO see propagated
#   records, so the filter is also attached to every root handler — covering
#   urllib3 and any future library without knowing its logger names.
# The enumeration of urllib3's URL-bearing lines is closed against the
# installed source (2.7.0): every other emitter logs host:port only
# (connection establishment/reset) or an absolute URL in one piece
# (``connection.py``'s header-parse warning), which the generic absolute-URL
# pass rewrites without a dedicated shape. The closure is version-anchored:
# a urllib3 upgrade can change these format strings and silently reopen it —
# re-run the emitter enumeration when bumping the dependency.
