# Persistence lifecycle

Postgres bootstrap owns its session-scoped advisory lock until `pg_advisory_unlock` completes. Drain that unlock across host cancellation before leaving the SQLAlchemy connection context; repeated cancellation must not return a pooled session while it still holds the bootstrap mutex. Ordinary database errors remain best-effort and are logged.
