"""SQL repository for the scheduled-task notification delivery outbox.

The completion hook calls :meth:`NotificationDeliveryRepository.enqueue`
(idempotent), and the delivery worker uses ``claim_due_deliveries`` /
``mark_sent`` / ``mark_failed``. Claim flips rows ``pending -> sending``
inside one transaction guarded by ``status = 'pending'``, so concurrent
workers (multi-pod deployments) cannot double-send the same row.
